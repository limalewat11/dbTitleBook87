In a quiet suburb of Detroit, the five Lisbon sisters-beautiful, eccentric, and obsessively watched by the neighborhood boys-commit suicide one by one over the course of a single year. As the boys observe them from afar, transfixed, they piece together the mystery of the family's fatal melancholy, in this hypnotic and unforgettable novel of adolescent love, disquiet, and death. Jeffrey Eugenides evokes the emotions of youth with haunting sensitivity and dark humor and creates a coming-of-age story unlike any of our time. Adapted into a critically acclaimed film by Sofia Coppola, <i>The Virgin Suicides</i> is a modern classic, a lyrical and timeless tale of sex and suicide that transforms and mythologizes suburban middle-American life.</p><p><b>For more than twenty years, Picador has been producing beautifully packaged literary fiction and nonfiction books from Manhattan's Flatiron Building. Our Twentieth Anniversary Modern Classics line pairs iconic books - <i>The Virgin Suicides</i> by Jeffrey Eugenides, <i>Steppenwolf</i> by Herman Hesse, <i>Jesus' Son</i> by Denis Johnson, and <i>Housekeeping</i> by Marilynne Robinson - with a design that's both small enough to fit in your pocket and unique enough to stand out on your bookshelf.</b></p></p><p><b>JEFFREY EUGENIDES</b> was born in Detroit and attended Brown and Stanford universities. <i>The Virgin Suicides</i> was published in 1993 and was adapted into a motion picture in 1999 by Sophia Coppola. His second novel, <i>Middlesex,</i> won the Pulitzer Prize in 2003. He joined the faculty of Princeton University in the fall of 2007. His most recent novel is <i>The Marriage Plot.</i><b>Chapter One</b> <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>On the morning the last Lisbon daughter took her turn at suicide&#x2014;it was Mary this time, and sleeping pills, like Therese&#x2014;the two paramedics arrived at the house knowing exactly where the knife drawer was, and the gas oven, and the beam in the basement from which it was possible to tie a rope. They got out of the EMS truck, as usual moving much too slowly in our opinion, and the fat one said under his breath, "This ain't TV, folks, this is how fast we go." He was carrying the heavy respirator and cardiac unit past the bushes that had grown monstrous and over the erupting lawn, tame and immaculate thirteen months earlier when the trouble began. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Cecilia, the youngest, only thirteen, had gone first, slitting her wrists like a Stoic while taking a bath, and when they found her, afloat in her pink pool, with the yellow eyes of someone possessed and her small body giving off the odor of a mature woman, the paramedics had been so frightened by her tranquillity that they had stood mesmerized. But then Mrs. Lisbon lunged in, screaming, and the reality of the room reasserted itself: blood on the bath mat; Mr. Lisbon's razor sunk in the toilet bowl, marbling the water. The paramedics fetched Cecilia out of the warm water because it quickened the bleeding, and put a tourniquet on her arm. Her wet hair hung down her back and already her extremities were blue. She didn't say a word, but when they parted her hands they found the laminated picture of the Virgin Mary she held against her budding chest. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>That was in June, fish&amp;-fly season, when each year our town is covered by the flotsam of those ephemeral insects. Rising in clouds from the algae in the polluted lake, they blacken windows, coat cars and streetlamps, plaster the municipal docks and festoon the rigging of sailboats, always in the same brown ubiquity of flying scum. Mrs. Scheer, who lives down the street, told us she saw Cecilia the day before she attempted suicide. She was standing by the curb, in the antique wedding dress with the shorn hem she always wore, looking at a Thunderbird encased in fish flies. "You better get a broom, honey," Mrs. Scheer advised. But Cecilia fixed her with her spiritualist's gaze. "They're dead," she said. "They only live twenty-four hours. They hatch, they reproduce, and then they croak. They don't even get to eat." And with that she stuck her hand into the foamy layer of bugs and cleared her initials: C.L. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>We've tried to arrange the photographs chronologically, though the passage of so many years has made it difficult. A few are fuzzy but revealing nonetheless. Exhibit #1 shows the Lisbon house shortly before Cecilia's suicide attempt. It was taken by a real estate agent, Ms. Carmina D'Angelo, whom Mr. Lisbon had hired to sell the house his large family had long outgrown. As the snapshot shows, the slate roof had not yet begun to shed its shingles, the porch was still visible above the bushes, and the windows were not yet held together with strips of masking tape. A comfortable suburban home. The uppe-right second-story window contains a blur that Mrs. Lisbon identified as Mary Lisbon. "She used to tease her hair because she thought it was limp," she said years later, recalling how her daughter had looked for her brief time on earth. In the photograph Mary is caught in the act of blow-drying her hair. Her head appears to be on fire but that is only a trick of the light. It was June 13, eighty-three degrees out, under sunny skies. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>When the paramedics were satisfied they had reduced the bleeding to a trickle, they put Cecilia on a stretcher and carried her out of the house to the truck in the driveway. She looked like a tiny Cleopatra on an imperial litter. We saw the gangly paramedic with the Wyatt Earp mustache come out first&#x2014;the one we'd call "Sheriff" when we got to know him better through these domestic tragedies&#x2014;and then the fat one appeared, carrying the back end of the stretcher and stepping daintily across the lawn, peering at his police-issue shoes as though looking out for dog shit, though later, when we were better acquainted with the machinery, we knew he was checking the blood pressure gauge. Sweating and fumbling, they moved toward the shuddering, blinking truck. The fat one tripped on a lone croquet wicket. In revenge he kicked it; the wicket sprang loose, plucking up a spray of dirt, and fell with a ping on the driveway. Meanwhile, Mrs. Lisbon burst onto the porch, trailing Cecilia's flannel nightgown, and let out a long wail that stopped time. Under the molting trees and above the blazing, overexposed grass those four figures paused in tableau: the two slaves offering the victim to the altar (lifting the stretcher into the truck), the priestess brandishing the torch (waving the flannel nightgown), and the drugged virgin rising up on her elbows, with an otherworldly smile on her pale lips. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Mrs. Lisbon rode in the back of the EMS truck, but Mr. Lisbon followed in the station wagon, observing the speed limit. Two of the Lisbon daughters were away from home, Therese in Pittsburgh at a science convention, and Bonnie at music camp, trying to learn the flute after giving up the piano (her hands were too small), the violin (her chin hurt), the guitar (her fingertips bled), and the trumpet (her upper lip swelled). Mary and Lux, hearing the siren, had run home from their voice lesson across the street with Mr. Jessup. Barging into that crowded bathroom, they registered the same shock as their parents at the sight of Cecilia with her spattered forearms and pagan nudity. Outside, they hugged on a patch of uncut grass that Butch, the brawny boy who mowed it on Saturdays, had missed. Across the street, a truckful of men from the Parks Department attended to some of our dying elms. The EMS siren shrieked, going away, and the botanist and his crew withdrew their insecticide pumps to watch the truck. When it was gone, they began spraying again. The stately elm tree, also visible in the foreground of Exhibit #1, has since succumbed to the fungus spread by Dutch elm beetles, and has been cut down. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The paramedics took Cecilia to Bon Secours Hospital on Kercheval and Maumee. In the emergency room Cecilia watched the attempt to save her life with an eerie detachment. Her yellow eyes didn't blink, nor did she flinch when they stuck a needle in her arm. Dr. Armonson stitched up her wrist wounds. Within five minutes of the transfusion he declared her out of danger. Chucking her under her chin, he said, "What are you doing here, honey? You're not even old enough to know how bad life gets." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>And it was then Cecilia gave orally what was to be her only form of suicide note, and a useless one at that, because she was going to live: "Obviously, Doctor," she said, "you've never been a thirteen&amp;-year-old girl." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The Lisbon girls were thirteen (Cecilia), and fourteen (Lux), and fifteen (Bonnie), and sixteen (Mary), and seventeen (Therese). They were short, round-buttocked in denim, with roundish cheeks that recalled that same dorsal softness. Whenever we got a glimpse, their faces looked indecently revealed, as though we were used to seeing women in veils. No one could understand how Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon had produced such beautiful children. Mr. Lisbon taught high-school math. He was thin, boyish, stunned by his own gray hair. He had a high voice, and when Joe Larson told us how Mr. Lisbon had cried when Lux was later rushed to the hospital during her own suicide scare, we could easily imagine the sound of his girlish weeping. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Whenever we saw Mrs. Lisbon we looked in vain for some sign of the beauty that must have once been hers. But the plump arms, the brutally cut steel-wool hair, and the librarian's glasses foiled us every time. We saw her only rarely, in the morning, fully dressed though the sun hadn't come up, stepping out to snatch up the dewy milk cartons, or on Sundays when the family drove in their paneled station wagon to St. Paul's Catholic Church on the Lake. On those mornings Mrs. Lisbon assumed a queenly iciness. Clutching her good purse, she checked each daughter for signs of makeup before allowing her to get in the car, and it was not unusual for her to send Lux back inside to put on a less revealing top. None of us went to church, so we had a lot of time to watch them, the two parents leached of color, like photographic negatives, and then the five glittering daughters in their homemade dresses, all lace and ruffle, bursting with their fructifying flesh. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Only one boy had ever been allowed in the house. Peter Sissen had helped Mr. Lisbon install a working model of the solar system in his classroom at school, and in return Mr. Lisbon had invited him for dinner. He told us the girls had kicked him continually under the table, from every direction, so that he couldn't tell who was doing it. They gazed at him with their blue febrile eyes and smiled, showing their crowded teeth, the only feature of the Lisbon girls we could ever find fault with. Bonnie was the only one who didn't give Peter Sissen a secret look or kick. She only said grace and ate her food silently, lost in the piety of a fifteen-year-old. After the meal Peter Sissen asked to go to the bathroom, and because Therese and Mary were both in the downstairs one, giggling and whispering, he had to use the girls', upstairs. He came back to us with stories of bedrooms filled with crumpled pan ties, of stuffed animals hugged to death by the passion of the girls, of a crucifix draped with a brassiere, of gauzy chambers of canopied beds, and of the effluvia of so many young girls becoming women together in the same cramped space. In the bathroom, running the faucet to cloak the sounds of his search,...</p><h2>Soccer Score (Sports Illustrated Kids Starting Line Readers)</h2><p>Mia runs fast. Mia kicks hard.

Like many kids, he was first inspired to become a manga artist in elementary school when he read Dragon Ball. After spending time in art college, he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his story Karakuri. After considering various genres for his next project, Kishimoto decided on a story steeped in traditional Japanese culture. His first version of Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in the world. The series would also spawn multiple anime series, movies, novels, video games and more. Having concluded the series in late 2014, Masashi Kishimoto has kept himself busy this year with the side story Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring and writing the story for the latest Naruto movie, Boruto: Naruto the Movie, both of which will focus on the title character&#39;s son, Boruto.</p><h2>Practice Makes Perfect: Complete French All-in-One, Premium Second Edition</h2><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b><br><b><br></b><br><b><br></b><b>The most comprehensive way to learn French &#x2013; with seven bestselling books in one!</b><br><b><br></b>Drawn from seven workbooks from the bestselling Practice Makes Perfect series, this powerhouse volume features all the knowledge and practice you need to master French.

Hatch charts, fly pattern recommendations, and important fishing strategies from Paul Weamer. This is the ideal reference for those just starting out or for those that want to have a more comprehensive view of the important insects. <br><br>Understanding aquatic insect hatches is like being able to cast an entire fly line. Do you need to cast that far to catch fish? Of course not. But will being able to cast a long distance inhibit your ability to catch fish? Never. Knowing where, and how, insects live and emerge gives anglers yet another piece of the puzzle. I've never heard a fly fisherman exclaim, &#x201c;I probably would have caught those rising fish if I just didn't know so much about trout stream insects.&#x201d; <br><br>You still need to cast. You still need to present flies in such a manner that fish will accept them. But though no one has ever failed to catch a trout because they knew too much about aquatic insects, plenty of anglers have not caught as big a fish, or as many fish as they could have caught, because they failed to understand the importance of matching a hatch. This is particularly true when fishing for large, wild, selective trout&#x2015;the ones we all really want to catch. <br><br>In this book, I try to relieve some of the reticence about trout stream insects that makes many anglers feel inadequate and uneasy. Many excellent books provide very detailed information about specific hatches. But that's not this book's goal. This book is written for new anglers who want a basic understanding of aquatic insects or more seasoned fly fishers who want to take their skills to the next level; those who want to know not only if their flies will work but why they'll work as well. I remember when I was first learning to fly fish, and I read about complicated Latin names or confusing stages of aquatic insect development. I was lost. It was as if the whole fly fishing world was born knowing about these things, and I was left out. This book's aim is to provide basic aquatic insect knowledge that will not only help you to understand more about trout stream insects, but it will also help you catch more trout on your next fishing trip. It will help you to understand why you should tie one fly to your leader rather than another to imitate the hatches you encounter. <br><br></p><p>Paul Weamer is a Fly Fisherman magazine contributing editor and the author or co-author of several fly fishing books.

Hatches by Caucci and Nastasi, Selective Trout by Richards and Swisher, and Western Mayfly Hatches by Hafele and Hughes are just a few of the great books that have laid the foundation for generations of hatch-matchers, but they are all outdated due to taxonomic shifts, and changes to the environment and our rivers (some good, some bad). <br><br>As a result, the fly-fishing world was in need of a modern, comprehensive aquatic food guide. Fly Fisherman contributing editor Paul Weamer answered the call with this: the most up-to-date match-thehatch guide fly fishers have available today and it&#x2019;s all digital in a full-color, transportable, convenient format that costs just $10. More important, Weamer breaks down the barriers between amateur and entomologist in a conversational tone, and explains when and why identifying insects can be both fun and practical. This is no snobby &#x201c;upstream, dryfly- only&#x201d; book about just aquatic insects. Weamer starts with the limnology of rivers and stillwaters, helps you understand the characters of everything from spring creeks and freestone rivers to reservoirs and ponds, and from there extrapolates to how the food base thrives and supports diverse trout populations. From scuds and sow bugs to aquatic worms and crane flies, you&#x2019;ll learn how to identify what you&#x2019;re seeing on stream, and the best options for imitating it. Weamer&#x2014;as we know from his many years as a guide on the Delaware River, his eloquent essays in Fly Fisherman (most recently &#x201c;A Century of Fishing the Hendrickson Hatch&#x201d; in the June-July issue), and his many previous publications is one of the brightest minds in fly fishing today&#x2014;and a passionate spokesman. <br><br>Let&#x2019;s hope he&#x2019;s got more books like this in store. -- Ross Purnell, Editor of Fly Fisherman magazine, <i>Fly Fisherman</i></p><h2>The Youngest Marcher: The Story of Audrey Faye Hendricks, a Young Civil Rights Activist</h2><p>Meet the youngest known child to be arrested for a civil rights protest in Birmingham, Alabama, 1963, in this moving picture book that proves you&#x2019;re never too little to make a difference.<br><br>Nine-year-old Audrey Faye Hendricks intended to go places and do things like anybody else.<br> <br>So when she heard grown-ups talk about wiping out Birmingham&#x2019;s segregation laws, she spoke up.

In a career spanning more than thirty years, Moore&#x2019;s life touched upon many historical events: the Occupation of Japan, the Korean War, Vietnam, and the refashioning of the US Army into an all-volunteer force. At each juncture, he learned critical lessons and had opportunities to affect change through measured responses.

Moore is a retired Lieutenant General in the United States Army. A 1945 graduate of West Point, Moore first saw combat during the Korean War, where he fought in the battles of Old Baldy, T-Bone, and Pork Chop Hill. At the beginning of the Vietnam War, he commanded the 1st Battalion of the 7th Cavalry in the Battle of Ia Drang, the first major battle between U.S. and North Vietnamese regulars. Together with Joseph Galloway, Moore later wrote of his experiences in the New York Times Bestseller, <i>We Were Soldiers Once...and Young</i>, which Hollywood later adapted into the film, <i>We Were Soldiers</i>, starring Mel Gibson. <br><br> After his retirement from active duty in 1977, Moore became the Executive Vice President of the Crested Butte Ski Area in Crested Butte, CO while maintaining a second home in Auburn, Alabama.

In an era of the military space race, Erich von D�niken boldly proclaimed that Earth had been visited by more advanced beings early in our history. But prescientific man had no concept of space ships, so he called their vehicles "chariots," and those driving the chariots became "gods."</p><p>Over the next five decades, von D�niken's more than 40 books built an ever-stronger case for Earth being visited by extraterrestrial visitors. And <i>Chariots</i> became an international best seller, with 30 million copies sold in more than two dozen languages. Also during that time, the case for ET visitations millennia ago was being reexamined by contemporary UFO researchers, who found evidence of modern visitations. And von D�niken expanded his perspective to encompass the present.</p><p>Now, he presents his long-awaited sequel to <i>Chariots of the Gods</i>, proclaiming that the gods never left us with all-new material to show that ancient aliens are still with us.</p><p><i>The Gods Never Left Us</i> contends that recent advancements in biotechnology, astrophysics, engineering, and artificial intelligence not only give us a fresh perspective on his ancient astronaut theory but actually validates it. We are--as a race--embarking on the exact same trajectory of our own interplanetary colonization, just as von D�niken suggested Earth itself was colonized.</p><p>ETs are definitely at work today.

As always, he ads his own "to the point" take on it all. Readers may also like that his newest work moves in a slightly different direction from his past books. A thoroughly enlightening and enjoyable Read." --<b>Bruce Cunningham</b>, Director, Ancient Mysteries International LLC &amp; Publisher of Advanced <i>Archaeology Review</i> magazine</p></p><p>Erich von D�niken is arguably the most widely read and most-copied nonfiction author in the world. He published his first (and best-known) book, Chariots of the Gods, in 1968. The worldwide best seller was followed by 40 more books, including the recent best sellers Twilight of the Gods, History Is Wrong, Evidence of the Gods, Remnants of the Gods, and Odyssey of the Gods (all published by New Page Books). His works have been translated into 28 languages and have sold more than 65 million copies. Several have also been made into films. Von D�niken's ideas have been the inspiration for a wide range of television series, including the History Channel's hit Ancient Aliens. His research organization, the A.A.S.R.A./legendarytimes.com (Archaeology, Astronautics &amp; SETI Research Association), comprises laymen and academics from all walks of life.

Even the imperial legions, long inured to the bloodshed, yearn for some respite. Yet Empress Laseen's rule remains absolute, enforced by her dread Claw assassins. </p><p>For Sergeant Whiskeyjack and his squad of Bridgeburners, and for Tattersail, surviving cadre mage of the Second Legion, the aftermath of the siege of Pale should have been a time to mourn the many dead. But Darujhistan, last of the Free Cities of Genabackis, yet holds out. It is to this ancient citadel that Laseen turns her predatory gaze. </p><p>However, it would appear that the Empire is not alone in this great game.

Educators with high efficacy show greater effort and persistence, willingness to try new teaching approaches, and attend more closely to struggling students&#x2019; needs.

Dr. Jenni Donohoo has seized the opportunity to take this work deeper and has, for me at least, provided the first really clear and comprehensive analysis of what efficacy is all about. <br> <br> This book is a thorough examination of the subject of efficacy in all its forms dating back to the work of Albert Bandura who really first made mention of this notion. Jenni has worked hard to uncover the extensive research base for the subject of efficacy and makes a sound case for the impact of collective efficacy in schools and organizations. <br> <br> Dr. Donohoo&#x2019;s previous work on Collaborative Inquiry is enhanced by this her most recent examination of the collaborative process which is her current passion and the focus of much of her writing and presenting. <br> <br> What adds great value apart from the extensive research base to support this notion of efficacy is the manner in which she makes this work come alive with suggestions for practical application. While there is lots of theoretical background Dr. Donohoo has taken time to make it applicable and practical for collaborative teams with robust appendices filled with useful protocols teams can apply immediately. <br> <br> This is a very helpful and valuable resource for any school leader and any group who see themselves working in a collaborative, team environment." </em><br> -- Ainsley B.

Homicides jumped nearly 17 percent in 2015 in the largest 50 cities, the biggest one-year increase since 1993. The reason is what Heather Mac Donald first identified nationally as the &#x201c;Ferguson effect&#x201d;: Since the 2014 police shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, officers have been backing off of proactive policing, and criminals are becoming emboldened. <br><br>This book expands on Mac Donald&#x2019;s groundbreaking and controversial reporting on the Ferguson effect and the criminal-justice system. It deconstructs the central narrative of the Black Lives Matter movement: that racist cops are the greatest threat to young black males. On the contrary, it is criminals and gangbangers who are responsible for the high black homicide death rate. <br><br><em>The War on Cops</em> exposes the truth about officer use of force and explodes the conceit of &#x201c;mass incarceration.&#x201d; A rigorous analysis of data shows that crime, not race, drives police actions and prison rates. The growth of proactive policing in the 1990s, along with lengthened sentences for violent crime, saved thousands of minority lives. In fact, Mac Donald argues, no government agency is more dedicated to the proposition that &#x201c;black lives matter&#x201d; than today&#x2019;s data-driven, accountable police department. <br><br>Mac Donald gives voice to the many residents of high-crime neighborhoods who want proactive policing. She warns that race-based attacks on the criminal-justice system, from the White House on down, are eroding the authority of law and putting lives at risk. This book is a call for a more honest and informed debate about policing, crime, and race. <br></p><p>Heather Mac Donald is the Thomas W.

Her essays helped to lay out the rationale that gave me and my police commissioners guidance during the largest continuous reduction in crime ever accomplished in our city and nation. This book is a necessary read for anyone wondering what is happening in the capital of the world.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> <br> The Honorable Rudolph Giuliani, former mayor of New York City<br> <i>The War on Cops</i> is an important and timely book.&nbsp;Mac Donald&#x2019;s clear-eyed analysis separates fact from fiction and provides keen insights into the politics at play and the consequences for law-enforcement officers and the communities they are sworn to protect.&#x201d;<br> <br> Ray Kelly, former commissioner of the New York City Police Department<br> If you have heard the rhetoric on all sides of the issues involving the police, and would like some facts to put that rhetoric to the test, there is no better source than <i>The War on Cops</i>. Whether you want facts about the explosive events in Ferguson, Missouri, or in Baltimore, or you want to know why murder rates in New York City fell sharply in the 1990s, this is the place to find solid information. If you want to understand the role of race in all this, that, too, is documented with data. This is a book that can save lives.&#x201d;<br> <br> Thomas Sowell, the Rose and Milton Friedman Senior Fellow on Public Policy at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University<br> Heather Mac Donald has made an indispensable contribution to our public debates with her incisive and critical reporting on the thorny issues of race, crime, and policing in America&#x2019;s big cities. Time and again, I have found myself turning to her writings for guidance. While I do not always agree with what I find, I often do. Moreover, I am invariably edified. All serious students of urban America today should read this book and reckon with its arguments.&#x201d;<br> <br> Glenn C. Loury, the Merton P. Stolz Professor of the Social Sciences, Brown University<br> <i>The War on Cops</i>&nbsp;offers a perspective that&nbsp;supporters of law enforcement have long been waiting for. It is informed by street-level reporting, knowledge of real-world policing, and empirical research. Unlike many in academia and journalism, Mac Donald understands that assertive policing protects law-abiding poor and often minority citizens trapped in ghettos where violence and crime are unfortunately making a comeback.&#x201d;<br> <br> Sheriff David A.

You should worry more about pediatrics than geriatrics.&#x201d; &#x2014;Mike&nbsp;Busch&nbsp;A&amp;P/IA</b></p> <p><i>Mike Busch on Engines</i> expands the iconoclastic philosophy of his groundbreaking first book <i>Manifesto</i> to the design, operation, condition monitoring, maintenance and troubleshooting of piston aircraft engines.</p> <p>Busch begins with the history and theory of four-stroke spark-ignition engines. He describes the construction of both the &#x201c;top end&#x201d; (cylinders) and &#x201c;bottom end&#x201d; (inside the case), and functioning of key systems (lubrication, ignition, carburetion, fuel injection, turbocharging). He reviews modern engine leaning technique (which your POH probably has all wrong), and provides a detailed blueprint for maximizing the life of your engine.</p> <p>The second half presents a 21st-century approach to health assessment, maintenance, overhaul and troubleshooting. Busch explains how modern condition monitoring tools&#x2014;like borescopy, oil analysis and digital engine monitor data analysis&#x2014;allow you to extend engine life and overhaul strictly on-condition rather at an arbitrary TBO. The section devoted to troubleshooting problems like rough running, high oil consumption, temperamental ignition and turbocharging issues is worth its weight in gold.</p> <p>If you want your engine to live long and prosper, you need this book.</p></p><p>Mike Busch is arguably the best-known A&amp;P/IA in general aviation. In 2008, he was honored by the FAA as &#x201c;National Aviation Maintenance Technician of the Year.&#x201d; Mike has been a prolific aviation writer for nearly five decades. His monthly &#x201c;Savvy Maintenance&#x201d; column appears in AOPA PILOT magazine, and his writing has appeared in numerous publications including EAA Sport Aviation, AOPA&#x2019;s Opinion Leader&#x2019;s Blog, AVweb, and magazines for the three largest GA type clubs (ABS, CPA, and COPA). He is renowned for his free monthly maintenance webinars and his standing-room-only forums at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh. Mike has been a pilot and aircraft owner for 50+ years with 8,000+ hours logged, and he is a CFIA/I/ME. He&#x2019;s founder and CEO of Savvy Aviation, Inc., the world&#x2019;s largest firm providing maintenance-management, consulting, analysis and breakdown assistance services for owner-flown aircraft.</p><h2>Great Lives: Paul: A Man of Grace and Grit (Great Lives Series)</h2><p><p>The apostle Paul. The converted terrorist, inspired author, amazing teacher, and patient mentor.This colossal figure strode boldly onto the stage of the first-century world and left an indelible signature of greatness never to be forgotten. His life? Magnificent! And his ministry? Impressive. While assigned sainthood by some today, by his own description he was "the chief of all sinners." No other person in the Bible, aside from Christ Himself, had a more profound influence on his world and ours than Paul.</p><p>He was a man of real grit, with a firmness of mind and spirit and unyielding courage in the face of personal hardship and danger. Tough, tenacious, and fiercely relentless, Paul pursued his divine mission with unflinching resolve. And God used him mightily to turn the world upside down for Christ in his generation.</p><p>But Paul's message and his style were also marked by gentle grace. This man, who tormented and killed the saints of God, understood and explained grace better than any of his contemporaries. Why? Because he never got over his own gratitude as a recipient of it. God's super-abounding grace transformed this once-violent aggressor into a humble-but-powerful spokesman for Christ. A man with that much grit desperately needed that much grace.</p><p>Perhaps that's why Paul's life is such a source of hope for us. If the chief of sinners can be forgiven and become God's chosen vessel, can He not forgive and use us as well? He can, if we too become people of both grace and grit.</p><p><em>Paul</em> is the sixth of a multi-volume series exploring Great Lives from God's Word and searching them to find the qualities that made them great. Join us for an exciting, in-depth look at this amazing life, as only Chuck Swindoll can describe it:<em>&nbsp; Paul: A Man of Grace and Grit</em>.</p></p><p><p>Charles R. Swindoll has devoted his life to the clear, practical teaching and application of God's Word. He currently pastors Stonebriar Community Church in Frisco, Texas, and serves as the chancellor of Dallas Theological Seminary. His renowned Insight for Living radio program airs around the world. Chuck and Cynthia, his partner in life and ministry, have four grown children and ten grandchildren.</p>Author Charles Swindoll analyzes the Apostle Paul&#39;s character, providing ancient and current illustrations that listeners can use to examine their own lives. In a seamless delivery, narrator Raymond Todd portrays Paul&#39;s journey to Damascus, as described by Swindoll, during which he is blinded and then experiences the restoration of his eyesight by God. Then, as an example of solitude, Swindoll recounts the story of the movie CAST AWAY, about a FedEx employee who is stranded on a deserted island for four years. With light enunciation, Todd describes how, like Paul, the executive comes to surrender his pride and desire for prestige when he realizes that being on top will result in a loneliness and isolation similar to what he is experiencing as a castaway. The story of Paul&#39;s journey motivates self-examination.

The purveyor of frosty treats is eagerly anticipated by all, but his friendly demeanor masks miraculous powers and a sinister omnipresence that links the tales. The lives of a young boy with a dark secret and a lethal &#x201c;friend,&#x201d; a desperate heroin addict, a washed-up one-hit wonder from the dawn of rock 'n' roll, and a young man wrestling with the fears and uncertainty of impending fatherhood all intersect with Rick, the ice cream man, on his route. As the stories progress, hints are dropped that there is more to Rick than simply serving as a Rod Serling for this contemporary <i>Twilight Zone</i>. Prince's work ups the ante from his earlier efforts (<i>One Week in the Library</i>) with a precisely-crafted page-turner, sporting crisp line work by Morazzo (<i>The Electric Sublime</i>) and the dreamlike colors of O'Halloran (<i>Magnus</i>).

Melanin is worth more than gold, silver, platinum, palladium rhodium and coltan combined. In just a few short years, on August 13, 2020 the Red, Black and Green flag will be celebrated as the colors of all African people. We also know the song lyric "Emancipate yourself from mental slavery, none but ourselves can free our minds," commonly associated with Bob Marley, actually originated with Marcus Garvey.&#x201c;We are going to emancipate ourselves from mental slavery, for though others may free the body, none but ourselves can free the mind.&#x201d; Those are the words which Marcus Garvey spoke in either October or November 1937. The place? Menelik Hall in Sydney, Nova Scotia. This selection of sayings of the Honorable Marcus Mosiah Garvey, provides an introduction to the mind of a man capable of speaking words into existence which continue to have a profound impact on those who hear them to this very day.Marcus Garvey was a journalist, editor, publisher, as well as founder, and President-General of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA.) This book serves as an introduction to the philosophy which made his ideas known worldwide. Notable among them is the phrase which has come to many sung as a paraphrased lyric by Bob Marley. Its organic power and compelling urge for a new mental state among the human race can not seriously be denied.This book is a distillation of Garvey thought. The product of years studying the words works and deeds of a man who left a legacy that is still so potent efforts continue to dissuade seekers of truth from his vision.Visit us on line at http://www.keyamsha.com to get the latest about Keyamsha, the Awakening.</p><p></p><h2>Nervous System (Quick Study Academic)</h2><p>Complete, labeled illustrations of the nervous system. <br><br>From pre-teen to pre-med, this chart is loaded with beautifully illustrated diagrams, clearly and concisely labeled for easy identification. <br><br>Illustrations by award-winning medical illustrator Vincent Perez. <br><br>Chart includes detailed diagrams of: <br>� nervous system <br>� cervicobrachial plexus <br>� lumbosacral plexus <br>� spinal cord <br>� nerve structure <br>� cutaneous innervation: dermatomes&nbsp;<br>&amp; &nbsp;peripheral nerve distributions</p><p></p><h2>Paul&#39;s Vision for the Deacons: Assisting the Elders with the Care of God&#39;s Church</h2><p>Views on the roles of deacons vary widely among evangelical Christians. What does Scripture actually teach about deacons and their role in the church? Views range from deacons being the board of directors, to the church building maintenance crew. Strauch states that his purpose in writing this book is to encourage my deacon friends and fellow church leaders to think more critically about what they are saying, what they are doing, and what Scripture actually teaches about deacons. Whatever your view of deacons may be, this study will help you examine in detail the biblical fact on deacons, allowing those facts to guide your thinking. This book offers the opportunity to build broader agreement among our Bible-believing churches as to what deacons do. Known for his deep love for the church and for his careful Bible exegesis, Strauch s new study cannot be ignored by churches that are committed to following a biblical church polity. This is not simply a revision of Strauch s popular book, <i>The New Testament Deacon: Minister of Mercy</i>.

This is an unforgettable tale about the healing, transcendent power of storytelling, and how learning to read saves one little boy.</p></p><p>Alan Armstrong started volunteering in a friend&#x2019;s bookshop when he was eight. At 14, he was selling books at Brentano&#x2019;s. As an adult, every so often, he takes to the road in a VW bus named Zora to peddle used books. He is the editor of <i>Forget Not Mee &amp; My Garden</i>, a collection of the letters of Peter Collinson, the 18th-century mercer and amateur botanist. He lives with his wife, Martha, a painter, in Massachusetts.<b>10<br>The Man Whittington Named Himself After<br></b>Bernie had to leave while he could still get the truck up. The kids wanted to stay. He said okay. Abby had a watch; he&#x2019;d collect them at three by the highway.<br><br>They could hear the storm. The wind sent flakes in through the cracks and the broken-out window up top. Ben shivered. The Lady had the kids pull down fresh hay. It fluffed up and smelled like summer. She made the horses lie down close together and had the kids snuggle next to them. She settled herself on one fluff, Couraggio on another. The bantams made a show of flying up to the rafters and perching where they could look over everything in comfort.<br><br>The cat was full of tuna. He wanted to lie down in a warm place too. The Lady told him to get up on the stall railing where everybody could see him.<br><br>&#x201c;Now go on with your story,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;Story? What story?&#x201d; the kids chorused.<br><br>Whittington shook himself. &#x201c;This is the story of rats and the cats that hunt them. Rats carry the fleas that carry plague. Plague makes your groin and underarms swell up and your tongue turn black. You get buboes and spots and foam at the mouth and die in agony. It&#x2019;s called the Black Death.<br><br>&#x201c;Dick Whittington&#x2019;s cat won him a fortune because she was a rat-hunter. Centuries before they figured out what plague was and how it spread, people knew that a good rat-hunter could save your life.<br><br>&#x201c;The man I&#x2019;m named for was born about the time the Black Death hacked through England like a filthy knife. By the time he was five years old a quarter of his town was empty. It was a horrible loneliness.<br><br>&#x201c;His family was poor. The soil was thin and ill-tended. There wasn&#x2019;t enough food. There were no schools. The grandmother who lived with his family taught him to read. The priest had taught her. There were no printed books. She copied out things on scraps of stiffened cloth and scraped animal skins called parchments. She wrote down remedies, recipes, family records, and Bible passages the priest taught her.<br><br>&#x201c;She smelled of the oils, herbs, and mint she used in the remedies she made. She was a midwife and a healer, one of the cunning folk they called her. The priest taught her reading and writing so she could copy recipes for remedies and keep the parish records. Dick gathered simples for her. He had a good eye. That was his work. Other boys his age picked stones from fields, gleaned corn, scared crows, drove geese. If you were idle you didn&#x2019;t eat.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What are simples?&#x201d; the Lady wanted to know. The kids nodded. They didn&#x2019;t know either.<br><br>&#x201c;Plants,&#x201d; the cat said. &#x201c;They made medicine then from leaves and blossoms, sap, roots. Dick&#x2019;s grandmother boiled and ground plants into ointments and syrups to heal people.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We fowl do that,&#x201d; the Lady said, looking at Couraggio. &#x201c;When we&#x2019;re ill we know what to eat to get better.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We do too,&#x201d; said Abby. &#x201c;When we&#x2019;re sick to the stomach Gran makes tea from the mint that grows around and stuff for hurts from tansy, the plant with yellow button flowers.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For colds she makes yarrow tonic and rose-hip paste,&#x201d; said Ben. &#x201c;She puts honey in the tonic. The rose stuff is bitter.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When I&#x2019;m sick I eat new grass,&#x201d; the cat said.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; said the Lady. &#x201c;Go on with your story.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dick was always surprised how warm his grandmother was when they sat close together. She read aloud the same things over and over, leading with her finger as she sounded out the letters. What he read to himself at first was what he remembered hearing as he followed her hand. He&#x2019;d mouth the words as he went along, sounding them out. Not many of his time knew how to read and few of those learned silent reading. He was a mumbling reader all his life.<br><br>&#x201c;One afternoon in the village he saw a gold coin. He&#x2019;d been loitering around a stout stranger hoping to perform some service and earn a tip when the man went into the baker&#x2019;s. Dick followed him in and watched as the stranger bought a halfpenny&#x2019;s worth of bread. The stranger got three round wheat loaves, honey-colored and heavy. He stuffed two into his coat and gave one to the boy. The man fumbled in his purse for a coin. He held it out for Dick to see. It was the size of a fingernail, stamped with a face. It gleamed like nothing Dick had ever seen before. What impressed him almost as much as its gleam was how carefully the baker studied it and weighed it and how many coins he gave in change.<br><br>&#x201c;Then one day outside the inn he overheard a carter telling the men helping him unload barrels of cider that he had heard from a man who had been there that London&#x2019;s streets were paved with gold and all the people were plump and healthy.<br><br> &#x201c;That night Dick had a dream. He dreamed he went to London and became the stout stranger, filling his purse with the small gleaming rounds of gold that lay like pebbles in the streets. He went to the baker and stuffed his pockets, he went to the inn and was served roast meat and cider. In his dream he was never hungry again. He wore warm clothes and was never cold again either.<br><br>&#x201c;He had heard talk that he was to be put in service to a tanner, a hard man who beat his boys and fed them poorly. Working with hides was a dirty, stinking business. The boys had to scrape off rotting flesh and hair and lift the heavy skins in and out of the tanbark vats. A boy in the tanner&#x2019;s service had hawked up blood and died. Dick figured he&#x2019;d better get out on his own pretty quick.&#x201d;</p><h2>Grandma&#39;s German Cookbook</h2><p>Whether it's crispy fried potatoes, steamed dumplings, or a creamy jelly roll stuffed with raspberries, no one makes food as good as a German grandmother &#x2014; that is, until now! <p>Featuring eighty-five classic recipes, from soups to Sunday roasts, and desserts to Christmas favorites, <i>Grandma's German Cookbook</i> is loaded with recipes any German grandmother would proudly serve her family.</p> <p>They'll also discover charming profiles of German grandmothers and their takes on classic dishes, for added authentic inspiration.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Little Dump Truck (Little Vehicles, 1)</h2><p><b>Handpicked by Amazon kids&#x2019; books editor, Seira Wilson, for Prime Book Box &#x2013; a children&#x2019;s subscription that inspires a love of reading.</b><br><br><p>Meet Hard Hat Pete and his little dump truck as they haul stones and rocks, carry debris, and unload at the landfill.

Adapted into the Oscar-winning film, this masterpiece immortalizes the lives of the hardscrabble residents who are threatened by the inexorable forces of the modern world.</p><p>In <i>The Last Picture Show</i> Larry McMurtry introduced characters who would show up again in later novels, <i>Texasville</i> and <i>Duane's Depressed</i>. This first volume of the trilogy drops the reader into the one-stoplight town of Thalia, Texas, where Duane Moore, his buddy Sonny, and his girlfriend Jacy are all stumbling along the rocky road to adulthood. Duane wants nothing more than to marry Jacy; Sonny wants what Duane has; and Jacy wants to get the hell out of Thalia any way she can. This is not a novel of big ideas or defining moments; over the course of a year Duane and Jacy make up and break up, Sonny begins an affair with his high-school football coach's wife, and the only movie house in town closes its doors forever. Yet it is out of these small-town experiences--a nude swimming party in Wichita, a failed sexual encounter during a senior trip, a botched elopement, an enlistment--that McMurtry builds his tale and reveals his characters' hearts. No epiphanies here, just a lot of hard-won experience that leaves none of his protagonists particularly wiser, though they're all a little sadder by the end. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>English for Everyone: English Idioms: An ESL Book of Over 1,000 English Phrases and Expressions</h2><p><b>Ideal for anyone who wants to learn English to native-speaker standard and prepare for major English exams including IELTS, TOEIC, and TOEFL, this fun and engaging visual guide to the most common and useful English idioms and phrases will help you understand and remember English idiomatic expressions and their meanings, making your English more fluent and natural.</b><br><br><i>English for Everyone: English Idioms</i> combines an innovative visual teaching method with the best of DK design to make one of the most difficult aspects of learning English as a foreign language incredibly easy.

Confined to small, hidden mystery schools for centuries, and often misunderstood and misinterpreted today. Tantra is not just a collection of techniques to enhance sexual experience. As Osho shows in these pages, it is a complete science of self-realization, based on the cumulative wisdom of centuries of exploration into the meaning of life and consciousness. Tantra&#x2015;the very word means &#x201c;technique&#x201d;&#x2015;is a set of powerful, transformative tools that can be used to bring new meaning and joy to every aspect of our daily lives.</p><p><b>Osho challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to enjoy life in all its richness. He has been described by the <i>Sunday Times</i> of London as one of the &#x201c;1000 Makers of the 20th Century&#x201d; and by <i>Sunday Mid-Day</i> (India) as one of the ten people&#x2015;along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha&#x2015;who have changed the destiny of India. Since his death in 1990, the influence of his teachings continues to expand, reaching seekers of all ages in virtually every country of the world.</b></p></p><p><b>Osho</b>, the philosopher and spiritual leader who rose to prominence in the sixties and seventies, continued teaching and guiding devoted followers up until his death in 1990. Many of Osho's techniques have been preserved by the Osho Foundation, which continues to practice and spread Osho's teachings.<p>1.<br>THE WORLD OF TANTRA<br>THE SUTRA<br>Devi asks:<br>Oh Shiva, what is your reality?<br>What is this wonder-filled universe?<br>What constitutes seed?<br>Who centers the universal wheel?<br>What is this life beyond form pervading forms?<br>How may we enter it fully, above space and time, names and descriptions?<br>Let my doubts be cleared!<br>Some introductory points. First, the world of Vigyan Bhairav Tantra is not intellectual, it is not philosophical. Doctrine is meaningless to it. It is concerned with method, with technique&#x2014;not with principles at all. The word tantra means technique, the method, the path. So it is not philosophical&#x2014;note this. It is not concerned with intellectual problems and inquiries. It is not concerned with the &#x201c;why&#x201d; of things, it is concerned with &#x201c;how&#x201d;; not with what is truth, but how the truth can be attained.<br>Tantra means technique. So this treatise is a scientific one. Science is not concerned with why, science is concerned with how. That is the basic difference between philosophy and science. Philosophy asks, &#x201c;Why this existence?&#x201d; Science asks, &#x201c;How this existence?&#x201d; The moment you ask the question, how?, method and technique become important. Theories become meaningless; experience becomes the center.<br>Tantra is science, Tantra is not philosophy. To understand philosophy is easy because only your intellect is required. If you can understand language, if you can understand concept, you can understand philosophy. You need not change; you require no transformation. As you are, you can understand philosophy&#x2014;but not Tantra.<br>You will need a change ... rather, a mutation. Unless you are different, Tantra cannot be understood because Tantra is not an intellectual proposition, it is an experience. Unless you are receptive, ready, vulnerable to the experience, it is not going to come to you.<br>Philosophy is concerned with the mind. Your head is enough; your totality is not required. Tantra needs you in your totality. It is a deeper challenge. You will have to be in it wholly. It is not fragmentary. A different approach, a different attitude, a different mind to receive it is required. Because of this, Devi is asking apparently philosophical questions. Tantra starts with Devi&#x2019;s questions. All the questions can be tackled philosophically.<br>Really, any question can be tackled in two ways: philosophically or totally, intellectually or existentially. For example, if someone asks, &#x201c;What is love?&#x201d; you can tackle it intellectually, you can discuss, you can propose theories, you can argue for a particular hypothesis. You can create a system, a doctrine&#x2014;and you may not have known love at all.<br>To create a doctrine, experience is not needed. Really, on the contrary, the less you know the better because then you can propose a system un-hesitatingly. Only a blind man can easily define what light is. When you do not know, you are bold. Ignorance is always bold; knowledge hesitates. And the more you know, the more you feel that the ground underneath is dissolving. The more you know, the more you feel how ignorant you are. And those who are really wise, they become ignorant. They become as simple as children, or as simple as idiots.<br>The less you know, the better. To be philosophical, to be dogmatic, to be doctrinaire&#x2014;this is easy. To tackle a problem intellectually is very easy. But to tackle a problem existentially&#x2014;not just to think about it, but to live it through, to go through it, to allow yourself to be transformed through it&#x2014;is difficult. That is, to know love one will have to be in love. That is dangerous because you will not remain the same. The experience is going to change you. The moment you enter love, you enter a different person. And when you come out you will not be able to recognize your old face; it will not belong to you. A discontinuity will have happened. Now there is a gap, the old man is dead and the new man has come. That is what is known as rebirth&#x2014;being twice-born.<br>Tantra is non-philosophical and existential. So of course Devi asks questions which appear to be philosophical, but Shiva is not going to answer them that way. So it is better to understand it in the beginning, otherwise you will be puzzled, because Shiva is not going to answer a single question. All the questions that Devi is asking, Shiva is not going to answer at all. And still he answers! And really, only he has answered them and no one else&#x2014;but on a different plane.<br>Devi asks, &#x201c;What is your reality, my lord?&#x201d; He is not going to answer it. On the contrary, he will give a technique. And if Devi goes through this technique, she will know. So the answer is roundabout; it is not direct. He is not going to answer &#x201c;Who am I?&#x201d; He will give a technique&#x2014;do it and you will know.<br>For Tantra, doing is knowing, and there is no other knowing. Unless you do something, unless you change, unless you have a different perspective to look at, to look with, unless you move in an altogether different dimension than the intellect, there is no answer. Answers can be given&#x2014;they are all lies. All philosophies are lies. You ask a question and the philosophy gives you an answer. It satisfies you or doesn&#x2019;t satisfy you. If it satisfies you, you become a convert to the philosophy, but you remain the same. If it doesn&#x2019;t satisfy you, you go on searching for some other philosophy to be converted to. But you remain the same; you are not touched at all, you are not changed.<br>So whether you are a Hindu or a Mohammedan or a Christian or a Jaina, it makes no difference. The real person behind the facade of a Hindu or a Mohammedan or a Christian is the same. Only words differ, or clothes. The man who is going to the church or to the temple or to the mosque is the same man. Only faces differ, and they are faces which are false; they are masks. Behind the masks you will find the same man&#x2014;the same anger, the same aggression, the same violence, the same greed, the same lust&#x2014;everything the same. Is Mohammedan sexuality different from Hindu sexuality? Is Christian violence different from Hindu violence? It is the same! The reality remains the same; only clothes differ.<br>Tantra is not concerned with your clothes, Tantra is concerned with you. If you ask a question it shows where you are. It shows also that wherever you are you cannot see; that is why there is the question. A blind man asks, &#x201c;What is light?&#x201d; and philosophy will start answering what is light. Tantra will know only this: if a man is asking &#x201c;What is light?&#x201d; it shows only that he is blind. Tantra will start operating on the man, changing the man, so that he can see. Tantra will not say what is light. Tantra will tell how to attain insight, how to attain seeing, how to attain vision. When the vision is there, the answer will be there. Tantra will not give you the answer; Tantra will give you the technique to attain the answer.<br>Now, this answer is not going to be intellectual. If you say something about light to a blind man, this is intellectual. If the blind man himself becomes capable of seeing, this is existential. This is what I mean when I say that Tantra is existential. So Shiva is not going to answer Devi&#x2019;s questions, still, he will answer&#x2014;the first thing.<br>The second thing: this is a different type of language. You must know something about it before we enter into it. All the Tantra treatises are dialogues between Shiva and Devi. Devi questions and Shiva answers. All the Tantra treatises start that way. Why? Why this method? It is very significant. It is not a dialogue between a teacher and a disciple, it is a dialogue between two lovers. And Tantra signifies through it a very meaningful thing: that the deeper teachings cannot be given unless there is love between the two&#x2014;the disciple and the master. The disciple and master must become deep lovers. Only then can the higher, the beyond, be expressed.<br>So it is a language of love; the disciple must be in an attitude of love. But not only this, because friends can be lovers. Tantra says a disciple moves as receptivity, so the disciple must be in a feminine receptivity; only then is something possible. You need not be a woman to be a disciple, but you need to be in a feminine attitude of receptivity. When Devi asks, it means the feminine attitude asks. Why this emphasis on the feminine attitude?<br>Man and woman are not only physically different, they are psychologically different. Sex is not only a difference in the body; it is a difference in psychologies also. A feminine mind means receptivity&#x2014;total receptivity, surrender, love. A disciple needs a feminine psychology; otherwise he will not be able to learn. You can ask, but if you are not open then you cannot be answered. You can ask a question and still remain closed. Then the answer cannot penetrate you. Your doors are closed; you are dead. You are not open.<br>A feminine receptivity means a womb-like receptivity in the inner depth, so that you can receive. And not only that&#x2014;much more is implied. A woman is not only receiving something, the moment she receives it, it becomes a part of her body. A child is received. A woman conceives; the moment there is conception, the child has become part of the feminine body. It is not alien, it is not foreign. It has been absorbed. Now the child will live not as something added to the mother, but just as a part, just as the mother. And the child is not only received: the feminine body becomes creative; the child begins to grow.<br>A disciple needs a womb-like receptivity. Whatsoever is received is not to be gathered as dead knowledge. It must grow in you; it must become blood and bones in you. It must become a part, now. It must grow! This growth will change you, will transform you&#x2014;the receiver. That is why Tantra uses this device. Every treatise starts with Devi asking a question and Shiva replying to it. Devi is Shiva&#x2019;s consort, his feminine part.<br>One thing more. ...

Chef Kim would eventually venture out on his own in 2008, bringing his imaginative Asian-inspired cuisine to his highly acclaimed Chicago restaurants Urbanbelly, bellyQ, and Belly Shack. <br><br><b>Chandra Ram</b>&nbsp;is the editor of <i>Plate</i> magazine.Introduction<br><br>I became a Korean American on a cold winter day in 1977, when my family landed in Chicago after emigrating from Seoul, South Korea. My parents decided to move us to America because they were worried for my brother and me. They wanted us to have more options and opportunities and thought America would provide them. But I didn&#x2019;t understand any of that when we arrived in Chicago. I was seven years old, I didn&#x2019;t speak the language, and I missed my friends in Seoul. In America, I was an alien: no one looked like me. I was miserable, and I just wanted to go back home.<br><br>I ditched my first day of school in Chicago. I grabbed my brother, who was six, and a book my Korean friends had filled with messages for me before we left, and we hid all day in the basement of the store where my family worked. Later, we found out the whole school had been looking for us, and I got into a lot of trouble. I had to apologize to the entire class and to the principal. After that, my parents took me to school every day for the rest of the year. They didn&#x2019;t trust me not to run away again.<br><br>I hated school that first year. I didn&#x2019;t understand what the teachers or other kids said to me, or what I was supposed to say to them. And then there was my name! My Korean name was Bum-Suk (and my brother&#x2019;s was Yu-Suk). Imagine going to elementary school and trying to fit in and make friends with names like that! All I wanted was a regular American name. That part of my childhood was hard, but I also cherish it in a strange way, because it&#x2019;s part of who I am today.<br><br>There were maybe only two other Asian kids in the whole school. I had to learn everything: currency, directions to the bathroom, even how to say hello. But slowly, it got better, and a year later, when more Korean immigrants came to our school, I was the one helping them get acclimated and guiding them through life in America. I didn&#x2019;t want them to go through the same trauma I had, and it made me happy to help others avoid it. When you are alone in a new country and then finally see someone who looks like you and understands where you come from, it&#x2019;s very comforting.<br><br>The experience was intense, but it showed me that if I could conquer a new school, a new language, and a new country, I could do anything. I got through it, and learned that the world isn&#x2019;t so bad, and that I could make it even better for others.<br><br>After living briefly with my aunt Janet, my parents rented a store and our family lived in the back, in one big room. We slept on mattresses on the floor and cooked on a hot plate; it wasn&#x2019;t too different from how we lived in Korea. We didn&#x2019;t feel bad for ourselves; it was just what we had, and we were perfectly fine with it. I earned extra money by picking up glass bottles to turn in for the nickel deposits.<br><br>I had some responsibilities as the oldest of five kids in the household (which included my three cousins), some of which were about food.&nbsp;<br><br>When we cooked and ate at home, our food was Korean with a lot of American touches. I had done a little bit of cooking before we left Seoul, including cooking my first cup of instant ramen over <i>seogtan</i> (burning coals) when I was just six. (Yes, my mom let me cook it without anybody helping me. Just remembering how dangerous that was makes me laugh. A little crazy, huh?)<br><br>My first kitchen duty in America was roasting sesame seeds and grinding them with a mortar and pestle for my mother&#x2019;s kimchi. Another of my jobs was carefully waving sheets of dried seaweed over an open gas flame to toast them for our snack. (Sometimes I&#x2019;d put them in our toaster.) Also, every afternoon after school, I had to wash the rice, let it soak, and remember to press the button on the rice cooker so the rice would be ready when my parents got home.<br><br>But making our after-school snack was my real specialty. The fridge was loaded with honey ham, roast beef, bologna, and American cheese slices. Coming from Korea, where we didn&#x2019;t eat sandwiches aside from the rare luxury of a butter and sugar sandwich, having so many choices was heaven and meant that I could make sandwiches with all of the meats. I still make them today; at our restaurants we call it &#x201c;phat style.&#x201d; I also had an infatuation with hot dogs: I ate them with rice, nori, buns, English muffins, anything, as long as there was tons of ketchup, and I still can&#x2019;t eat a hot dog without ketchup. (In Chicago, people go crazy if you eat hot dogs with ketchup, so I pretend the ketchup is for the fries but use it for the hot dogs. But keep that quiet!) I didn&#x2019;t know it then, but those early days of caring for my family with food was when I began the process of becoming a chef.<br><br>But my best food memories are from when we would get together with other Korean families to barbecue in the park. We were&nbsp;doing the most American thing, setting up grills, playing games, chasing one another, and cooking food, but our food was Korean. We were acclimating, but slowly.<br><br>As we settled into life in Chicago, we moved around the city a bit, each time learning about other cultures from our neighbors. We lived between an Indian neighborhood and a Jewish neighborhood, in an area where a lot of immigrants had landed. There were people there from all over the world, but we accepted one another. Then we moved to an Italian neighborhood. I remember the neighbors thought we were crazy when my mom strung fish on the clothesline attached to the pear tree in the front yard to dry them, right next to our clothes. To fertilize the garden, she buried fish heads in the soil&#x2014;they had to be buried deeply to keep the flies away&#x2014; and put crushed eggshells on top. Mom loved her garden; she grew sesame leaves (also known as perilla), Korean chilies, and little Kirby cucumbers to make kimchi.<br><br>I had a great time living in that house. My best friend, Tony Bruno, lived nearby, and we&#x2019;d go to his house after school. Tony&#x2019;s family was as Italian as mine was Korean, but there were some similarities. Neither of our mothers spoke English, so we both understood what it was like to be the kid who had to translate conversations for his mom. Tony&#x2019;s family had a garden like ours, but they grew tomatoes. Instead of drying fish on a clothesline, they would dry, salt, and cure their tomatoes in wicker baskets under the sun. They even made their own wine (which, of course, Tony and I tried a few times). Looking back, I realize that Tony&#x2019;s life was like mine, just based in a different culture. It might have been fish drying out back at my house and tomatoes drying at his house, but we were both immigrant kids trying to figure out how to fit in and what it meant to be an American.<br><br>I got used to life in Chicago but I never really felt like I fully assimilated, especially at school, which wasn&#x2019;t for me; I was a very average student. In my junior year, school became a scary place for me, because that was when a lot of my friends picked the college they wanted to attend. Where was I going to get in? What would I major in? How was my family going to afford college? I had no idea. I went to the college night at the local junior college and saw the banners for all of the Ivy League schools&#x2014;Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Brown. I was about to walk out when I saw a giant white-and-blue wedding cake in the middle of the room, topped with a man in a blue tuxedo next to a bride. At first, I thought it was weird that someone was getting married at a college, but as I approached the cake, a representative from a culinary school asked me if I was interested in cooking. That was when I realized the cake was decorated to match the logo of the school.<br><br>A school for cooking? Was this for real? I had a million questions. What did I have to do to get in? What did my GPA need to be? How much did it cost? Even with all of these questions, I was relieved that I had found a path I wanted to walk. And I only found it after noticing that wedding cake. If I hadn&#x2019;t seen it, I don&#x2019;t know if I would be cooking today.<br><br>When I told my parents I wanted to attend culinary school, they were very supportive, but at the same time had no clue what that meant. I think they were just glad that I was going to get a degree in something. I decided to first enroll in the culinary training program at the local junior college, to save money and to stay close to home. No one I knew went to cooking school, so I was scared about wasting money, and this was an easy way to make sure a career in cooking was right for me. But once I started my classes, I knew I had found my calling. I went to&nbsp;class and inhaled the smell of paprika, and of onions caramelizing in a pan. Those smells, the chaos of the day, tasting all of the food&#x2014;it was a dream come true. Don&#x2019;t get me wrong; it was hard work. But I knew this was something I could make a career out of while following my passion for food.</p><h2>Loyola Kids Book of Saints</h2><p>Book of SaintsWho are the saints, why are the lives of saints important for children, and what can children learn from lives and actions?

Inspired by her mother, who taught nursery school and went on to be a school guidance counselor and administrator, Maestro always wanted to be a teacher, and in preparation she filled her high school summer vacations with jobs baby-sitting, tutoring, and even supervising playgrounds. She received a Bachelor's degree in Early Childhood Education at Southern Connecticut State College and a Master's degree in Elementary Guidance from the same institution. Maestro taught kindergarten and first grade for 11 years, during which time she became aware of the need for imaginative nonfiction to spark children's interests.<br><br>After marrying artist Giulio Maestro in 1972, Maestro decided to try writing herself. Since then the couple has collaborated on more than 50 books for children, all of them picture books, many of them nonfiction and concept books. They have received numerous awards and citations for their work. When she is not writing, Betsy Maestro enjoys reading, cooking, photography, travel, art, and antiques. She and her husband have two children and live in Old Lyme, Connecticut. <br>Ages 5^-9. The sentiments of this picture book celebrate America's rich diversity as a nation of immigrants, and the history is inclusive; but the determinedly upbeat message is overdone, especially in the illustrations, which exaggerate folksy culture, beads-and-feathers kind of costuming, festive foods, and gleeful holiday togetherness. Diversity is enriching, and it's who we are, but few Americans will recognize this cute idyll. The history is better. Maestro begins with the first nomads, the American Indians, and does mention that Indians were later pushed off their land. She also notes that millions of Africans were forcibly brought to the Americas as slaves. She describes the successive waves of people who have come here through the centuries: why they left their homes, how they journeyed, what their hopes were, how they settled, and how today's new immigrants continue to come in search of a better life for themselves and their children. It's in the present scenes that the style lapses into sermonizing about "the growing appreciation and understanding of the special character and unique contributions of each cultural or ethnic group" --hardly picture-book text. But the history is a useful introduction. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation (Light Novel) Vol. 2</h2><p><p><b>THE PUPIL BECOMES THE MASTER!</b><br><b></b><br>Rudeus is shipped off to Roa, the largest city in the region, to tutor the young daughter of a noble family.

Visionary in business, she has long looked at the world through a child&#x2019;s eyes, infusing her stories and lessons with joy and relatability.</p> <p>&nbsp;As a mother of 4 back in the &#x2018;70s, like moms the world over throughout history, she wanted what was best for her children. And she knew that teachers didn&#x2019;t have the time to give her kids everything they needed. As an elementary school teacher, Hoffman worked hard to give her students what they needed to learn. And parents would ask her what they could do to help. That&#x2019;s why she started School Zone&#x2014;to help give children every possible chance to reach their potential.&nbsp;</p> <p>She brought retail experience gleaned from previously founding and managing two regional educational book and supply stores for teachers and parents.

At his wit&#x2019;s end, M decides that the only way to snap his best agent out of his torpor is to send him on an impossible diplomatic mission to Japan. Bond&#x2019;s contact there is the formidable Japanese spymaster Tiger Tanaka, who agrees to do business with the West if Bond will assassinate one of his enemies: a mysterious Swiss botanist named Dr. Guntram Shatterhand. </p><p>Shatterhand is not who he seems, however, and his impregnable fortress&#x2014;known to the locals as the &#x201c;Castle of Death&#x201d;&#x2014;is a gauntlet of traps no <i>gaijin</i> has ever penetrated. But through rigorous ninja training, and with some help from the beautiful and able Kissy Suzuki, Bond manages to gain access to Shatterhand&#x2019;s lair. Inside lurks certain doom at the hands of 007&#x2019;s bitterest foe&#x2014;or a final chance to exact ultimate vengeance.</p><p><b>The text in this edition has been restored by the Fleming family company Ian Fleming Publications, to reflect the work as it was originally published.</b></p><p><b>www.ianfleming.com </b></p></p><p>Ian Fleming was born in London on May 28, 1908. He was educated at Eton College and later spent a formative period studying languages in Europe. His first job was with Reuters News Agency where a Moscow posting gave him firsthand experience with what would become his literary <i>bete noire</i>&#x2014;the Soviet Union. During World War II he served as Assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence and played a key role in Allied espionage operations. <p>After the war he worked as foreign manager of the <i>Sunday Times</i>, a job that allowed him to spend two months each year in Jamaica. Here, in 1952, at his home &#x201c;Goldeneye,&#x201d; he wrote a book called <i>Casino Royale</i>&#x2014;and James Bond was born. The first print run sold out within a month. For the next twelve years Fleming produced a novel a year featuring Special Agent 007, the most famous spy of the century. His travels, interests, and wartime experience lent authority to everything he wrote. Raymond Chandler described him as &#x201c;the most forceful and driving writer of thrillers in England.&#x201d; Sales soared when President Kennedy named the fifth title, <i>From Russia With Love</i>, one of his favorite books. The Bond novels have sold more than one hundred million copies worldwide, boosted by the hugely successful film franchise that began in 1962 with the release of <i>Dr. No</i>. </p><p>He married Anne Rothermere in 1952. His story about a magical car, written in 1961 for their only son Caspar, went on to become the well- loved novel and film <i>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</i>. </p><p>Fleming died of heart failure on August 12, 1964, at the age of fifty-six.</p>&nbsp; <b>1. SCISSORS CUT PAPER</b> <p>The geisha called 'Trembling Leaf, on her knees beside James Bond, leant forward from the waist and kissed him chastely on the right cheek.</p> <p>'That's a cheat,' said Bond severely. 'You agreed that if I won it would be a real kiss on the mouth. At the very least,' he added.</p> <p>'Grey Pearl', the Madame, who had black lacquered teeth, a bizarre affectation, and was so thickly made up that she looked like a character out of a noh play, translated. There was much giggling and cries of encouragement. Trembling Leaf covered her face with her pretty hands as if she were being required to perform some ultimate obscenity. But then the fingers divided and the pert brown eyes examined Bond's mouth, as if taking aim, and her body lanced forward. This time the kiss was full on the lips and it lingered fractionally. In invitation? In promise? Bond remembered that he had been promised a 'pillow geisha'. Technically, this would be a geisha of low caste. She would not be proficient in the traditional arts of her calling - she would not be able to tell humorous stories, sing, paint or compose verses about her patron. But, unlike her cultured sisters, she might agree to perform more robust services - discreetly, of course, in conditions of the utmost privacy and at a high price. But, to the boorish, brutalised tastes of a gaijin, a foreigner, this made more sense than having a tanks of thirty-one syllables, which in any case he couldn't understand, equate, in exquisite ideograms, his charms with budding chrysanthemums on the slopes of Mount Fuji.</p> <p>The applause which greeted this unbridled exhibition of lasciviousness died quickly and respectfully. The powerful, chunky man in the black Jukata, sitting directly across the low red lacquer table from Bond, had taken the Dunhill filter holder from between his golden teeth and had laid it beside his ashtray. 'Bondo-san,' said Tiger Tanaka, Head of the Japanese Secret Service, 'I will now challenge you to this ridiculous game, and I promise you in advance that you will not win.' The big, creased brown face that Bond had come to know so well in the past month split expansively. The wide smile closed the almond eyes to slits - slits that glittered. Bond knew that smile. It wasn't a smile. It was a mask with a golden hole in it.</p> <p>Bond laughed. 'All right, Tiger. But first, more saks! And not in these ridiculous thimbles. I've drunk five flasks of the stuff and its effect is about the same as one double Martini. I shall need another double Martini if I am to go on demonstrating the superiority of Western instinct over the wiles of the Orient, Is there each a thing as a lowly glass tumbler discarded in some corner behind the cabinets of Ming?'</p> <p>'Bondo-san. Ming is Chinese. Your knowledge of porcelain is as meagre as your drinking habits are gross. Moreover, it is unwise to underestimate saks. We have a saying, "It is the man who drinks the first flask of saks then the second flask drinks the first; then it is the saks that drinks the man.'" Tiger Tanaka turned to Grey Pearl and there followed a laughing conversation which Bond interpreted as jokes at the expense of this uncouth Westerner and his monstrous appetites. At a word from the Madame, Trembling Leaf bowed low and scurried out of the room. Tiger turned to Bond. 'You have gained much face, Bondo-san. It is only the sums wrestlers who drink saks in these quantities without showing it. She says you are undoubtedly an eight-flask man.' Tiger's face became sly. 'But she also suggests that you will not make much of a companion for Trembling Leaf at the end of the evening.'</p> <p>'Tell her that I am more interested in her own more mature charms. She will certainly possess talents in the art of love making which will overcome any temporary lassitude on my part.' This leaden gallantry got what it deserved. There came a spirited crackle of Japanese from Grey Pearl. Tiger translated. 'Bondo-san this is a woman of some wit. She has made a joke. She says she is already respectably married to one bonsan and there is no room on her futon for another. Bansan means a priest, a greybeard. Futon, as you know, is a bed. She has made a joke on your name.'</p> <p>The geisha party had been going on for two hours, and Bond's jaws were aching with the unending smiles and polite repartee. Far from being entertained by the geisha, or bewitched by the inscrutable discords issuing from the catskin-covered box of the three-stringed samisen, Bond had found himself having to try desperately to make the party go. He also knew that Tiger Tanaka had been observing his effort with a sadistic pleasure. Dikko Henderson had warned him that geisha parties were more or less the equivalent, for a foreigner, of trying to entertain a lot of unknown children in a nursery with a strict governess, the Madame, looking on. But Dikko had also warned him that he was being done a great honour by Tiger Tanaka, that the party would cost Tiger a small fortune, whether from secret funds or from his own pocket, and that Bond had better put a good face on the whole thing since this looked like being a breakthrough in Bond's mission. But it could equally well be disaster.</p> <p>So now Bond smiled and clapped his hands in admiration. He said to Tiger, 'Tell the old bitch she's a clever old bitch,' accepted the brimming tumbler of hot saks from the apparently adoring hands of Trembling Leaf, and downed it in two tremendous gulps. He repeated the performance so that more saks had to be fetched from the kitchen, then he placed his fist decisively on the red lacquer table and said with mock belligerence, 'All right. Tiger! Go to it!'</p> <p>It was the old game of Scissors cut Paper, Paper wraps Stone, Stone blunts Scissors, that is played by children all over the world. The fist is the Stone, two out-stretched fingers are the Scissors, and a flat hand is the Paper. The closed fist is hammered twice in the air simultaneously by the two opponents and, at the third downward stroke, the chosen emblem is revealed. The game consists of guessing which emblem the opponent will choose, and of you yourself choosing one that will defeat him. Best of three goes or more. It is a game of bluff.</p> <p>Tiger Tanaka rested his fist on the table opposite Bond. The two men looked carefully into each other's eyes. There was dead silence in the box-like little lath-and-paper room, and the soft gurgling of the tiny brook in the ornamental square of garden outside the opened partition could be heard clearly for the first time that evening. Perhaps it was this silence, after all the talk and giggling, or perhaps it was the deep seriousness and purpose that was suddenly evident in Tiger Tanaka's formidable, cruel, samurai face, but Bond's skin momentarily crawled. For some reason this had become more than a children's game. Tiger had promised he would beat Bond. To fail would be to lose much face. How much? Enough to breach a friendship that had become oddly real between the two of them over the past weeks? This was one of the most powerful men in Japan. To be defeated by a miserable gaijin in front of the two women might be a matter of great moment to this man. The defeat might leak out through the women. In the West, such a trifle would be farcically insignificant, like a cabinet minister losing a game of backgammon at Blades. But in the East? In a very short while, Dikko Henderson had taught Bond total respect for Oriental conventions, however old-fashioned or seemingly trivial, but Bond was still at sea in their gradations. This was a case in point. Should Bond try and win at this baby game of bluff and double-bluff, or should he try to lose? But to try and lose involved the same cleverness at correctly guessing the other man's symbols in advance. It was just as difficult to lose on purpose as to win. And anyway did it really matter? Unfortunately, on the curious assignment in which James Bond was involved, he had a nasty feeling that even this idiotic little gambit had significance towards success or failure.</p> <p>As if with second sight. Tiger Tanaka spelled the problem out. He gave a harsh, taut laugh that was more of a shout than an expression of humour or pleasure. 'Bondo-san, with us, and certainly at a party at which I am the host and you are the honoured guest, it would be good manners for me to let you win this game that we are to play together. It would be more. It would be required behaviour. So I must ask your forgiveness in advance for defeating you.'</p> <p>Bond smiled cheerfully. 'My dear Tiger, there is no point in playing a game unless you try to win. It would be a very great insult to me if you endeavoured to play to lose. But if I may say so, your remarks are highly provocative. They are like the taunts of the sumo wrestlers before the bout. If I was not myself so certain of winning, I would point out that you spoke in English. Please tell our dainty and distinguished audience that I propose to rub your honourable nose in the dirt at this despicable game and thus display not only the superiority of Great Britain, and particularly Scotland, over Japan, but also the superiority of our Queen over your Emperor.' Bond, encouraged perhaps by the crafty ambush of the sake, had committed himself. This kind of joking about their different cultures had become a habit between himself and Tiger, who, with a first in PPE at Trinity before the war, prided himself in the demokorasu of his outlook and the liberality and breadth of his understanding of the West. But Bond, having spoken, caught the sudden glitter in the dark eyes, and he thought of Dikko Henderson's cautionary, 'Now listen, you stupid limey bastard. You're doing all right. But don't press your luck. T.T.'s a civilized kind of a chap - as Japs go, that is. But don't overdo it. Take a look at that mug. There's Manchu there, and Tartar. And don't forget the soanso was a Black Belt at judo before he never went up to your bloody Oxford. And don't forget he was spying for Japan when he called himself assistant naval attache in their London Embassy before the war and you s...</p></p><h2>The Jewish Cookbook</h2><p><p><b>A rich trove of contemporary global Jewish cuisine, featuring hundreds of stories and recipes for home cooks everywhere</b></p><p><i>The Jewish Cookbook</i> is an inspiring celebration of the diversity and breadth of this venerable culinary tradition.

To escape Redd, Alyss and her bodyguard, Hatter Madigan, must flee to our world through the Pool of Tears. But in the pool Alyss and Hatter are separated. Lost and alone in Victorian London, Alyss is befriended by an aspiring author to whom she tells the violent, heartbreaking story of her young life. Yet he gets the story all wrong. Hatter Madigan knows the truth only too well, and he is searching every corner of our world to find the lost princess and return her to Wonderland so she may battle Redd for her rightful place as the Queen of Hearts.</p><p>Frank Beddor is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The Looking Glass Wars,</i> the young-adult novel that first introduced young readers to the true story of Alyss. He lives in Los Angeles, California.<b>Chapter 1</b><p>THE QUEENDOM had been enjoying a tentative peace ever since the time, twelve years earlier, when unbridled bloodshed spattered the doorstep of every Wonderlander. The civil war hadn't been the longest in all of recorded history, but no doubt it was one of the bloodiest. Those who had entered a little too quickly into the carnage and destruction had trouble adapting to life during peacetime. When hostilities ceased, they ran amok on the streets of Wonderland's capital city, looting and pillaging Wondertropolis until Queen Genevieve had them rounded up and shipped off to the Crystal Mines&#x2014;a spiderweb-like network of tunnels carved in a far-off mountainside, where those unwilling to abide by the laws of decent society lived in windowless dormitories and labored to excavate crystal from the unforgiving mountain. Even after these people were taken off the streets, the peace that settled on Wonderland was nothing like that which had existed before the war. A third of Wondertropolis' quartz-like buildings had to be rebuilt. The smooth turquoise amphitheater had suffered damage in an air raid, as had the public works towers and spires sporting fiery, reflective pyrite skin. But the scars of war are not always visible. Although Queen Genevieve ruled her queendom judiciously, with care for the well-being of her people, the monarchy had forever been weakened. The coalition of Diamond, Club, and Spade dynasties that made up Parliament were falling apart. The matriarchs of the families were jealous of Genevieve's power. Each thought she could rule Wonderland better then the queen. Each watched and waited for an opportunity to wrest control from her, keeping a none-too-friendly eye on the other families in case they happened to make a move first. </p><p>Entertaining no thoughts of war, Princess Alyss Heart stood on the balcony of Heart Palace with her mother, Queen Genevieve. The city was in the midst of a jubilant gala. From the Everlasting Forest to the Valley of Mushrooms, Wonderlanders had come to celebrate the seventh birthday of their future queen, who, as it happened, was bored out of her wits. Alyss knew she could do a lot worse than be Queen of Wonderland, but even a future monarch doesn't always want to do what she is supposed to do&#x2014;like site through hours of pageantry. She would rather have hidden with her friend Dodge in one of the palace towers, dropping jollyjellies from an open window and watching them splat on the guards below. Dodge wouldn't like the jollyjelly bit&#x2014;guardsmen deserved better treatment, he'd say&#x2014;but that would only make it more fun. </p><p>Where <i>was</i> Dodge anyway? She hadn't seen him all morning, and it wasn't nice to avoid the birthday girl on her birthday. She searched for him among the Wonderlanders gathered to watch the Inventors' Parade on the cobbled lane below. No sign of him. He was probably off doing something fun; whatever it was had to be more fun than being stuck here, forced to watch Wonderlanders show off their silly contraptions. Bibwit Harte, the royal tutor, had explained to her that most of Wonderland took pride in the Inventors' Parade, the one time every year when citizens flaunted their skills and ingenuity before the queen. If Genevieve saw something in the parade that she thought particularly good, she would send it into the Heart Crystal&#x2014;a thirty-three-foot-tall, fifty-two-foot-wide shimmering crystal on the palace grounds, the power source for all creation. Whatever passed into the crystal went out into the universe to inspire imaginations in other worlds. If a Wonderlander bounced in front of Queen Genevieve on a spring-operated stick with handlebars and footrests and she passed this curious invention into the crystal, before long, in one civilization or another, a pogo stick would be invented. </p><p>Still, Alyss wondered, what was the big deal? Having to stand here until her feet hurt&#x2014;it was punishment. </p><p>"I wish Father was here." </p><p>"He's due back form Boarderland at any moment," said Queen Genevieve. "But since the rest of Wonderland is here, I suggest you try to enjoy yourself for their sake. That's interesting, don't you think?" </p><p>They watched as a man floated down from the sky with what looked like a hollow mushroom cap strapped to his back. </p><p>"It's pretty good, I suppose," said Alyss, " but it'd be better if it were furry." </p><p>And with that, the mushroom contraption was suddenly covered with fur, its inventor falling to the ground with a thump. </p><p>Queen Genevieve frowned. </p><p>"He's late," Alyss said. "He promised he'd be here. I don't understand why he had to make a trip so close to my birthday." </p><p>There <i>were</i> reasons, as the queen well knew. Intelligence had indicated that they may have already waited too long. Unconfirmed reports suggested Redd was growing more powerful, outfitting her troops for an attack, and Genevieve was no longer sure that her military could provide adequate defense. She was as keen as Alyss for King Nolan's return, but she had determined to enjoy the day's festivities. </p><p>"Ooh, look at that," she said, pointing at a woman wiggling as she walked so as to keep a large hoop swinging round and round her waist." That looks diverting." </p><p>"It'd be more fun if it had fountains of water coming out of it," Alyss said, and immediately the hoop was spurting water from tiny holes all along its surface, the surprised inventor still wiggling to keep it swinging round and round. </p><p>"Birthday or not, Alyss," Queen Genevieve said, "I don't think it's nice to show off." </p><p>The fur on the first-ever parachute vanished. The fountains of water on the newly invented hula hoop dried up. The power of Alyss' imagination had made them appear and disappear. Imagination was an important part of life in Wonderland, and Alyss had the most powerful imagination ever seen in a seven year-old Wonderlander. But as with any formidable talent, Alyss' imagination could be used for good or ill, and the queen saw mild reasons for concern. Hardly one revolution of the Thurmite moon had passed since Alyss' last incident: Impatient with young Jack of Diamonds for some childish indiscretion, she's imagined his trousers filled with slick, squiggling gwormmies. Jack of Diamonds had said he "felt something funny," looked down, and saw that his trousers were moving, alive. He'd been having nightmares ever since. Alyss claimed not to have done it on purpose, which may or may not have been true, Genevieve couldn't tell. Alyss didn't yet have full control of her imaginative powers, but the girl would say anything to get out of trouble. </p><p>"You will be the strongest queen yet," she told her daughter. "Your imagination will be the crowning achievement of the land. But Alyss, you must work hard to develop it according to the guiding principles of the Heart dynasty&#x2014;love, justice, and duty to the people. An undisciplined imagination is worse than no imagination at all. It can do more harm. Remember what happened to your aunt Redd." </p><p>"I know," Alyss said sulkily. She had never met her aunt Redd, but she'd heard storied about the woman for as long as she could remember. She didn't bother trying to understand it all; it was <i>history</i>&#x2014;boring boring boring. But she knew that to be like her aunt Redd wasn't good. </p><p>"Now that's enough lecturing for one princess' birthday," Queen Genevieve said. She clapped her hands and the parachute and hula hoop passed into the Heart Crystal, much to the joy of their inventors. </p><p>An empty pair of King Nolan's boots floated out from behind the balcony door and began to dance in front of the brooding princess. </p><p>Queen Genevieve, watching yet another extraordinary display of her daughter's imagination, said, "Alyss." </p><p>Something in her tone made the girl stop what she was doing. The boots thudded to the ground, still. </p><p>"It's all in your head," the queen sighed. "Remember that, love. Whatever happens, it's all in your head." </p><p>It was both a warning and an expression of hope: Queen Genevieve, aware of the dark forces at work somewhere in the wastes of the Chessboard Desert, knew that joy and happiness didn't last forever in Wonderland; sooner or later the queendom would come under attack, and it would require all of Alyss' imaginative powers&#x2014;and then some&#x2014;to ensure its survival. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Memoirs of a Hamster</h2><p>Night 1 / My life is perfect. / I have a bowl full of seeds, a cozy pile of wood shavings, and room to run. / I&#39;m never leaving here. / Question: Who&#39;s the luckiest hamster in the world? / Answer: ME! Seymour the hamster has the perfect life. He has a spacious cage, a constant food supply, and a FuzzyBoy 360 exercise wheel that lets him run to his heart&#39;s content. Life could not be better. Or could it? When Pearl the cat tells Seymour of the goodies beyond the safe confines of his cage, he starts to think he&#39;s missing out. And out is the new in! It&#39;s only after Seymour is out of his cage that he begins to fully appreciate his safe and cozy home.</p><p>K-Gr 2-Seymour, a hamster, has the ideal life, according to his day-by-day memoir. He's got a bowl of seeds, a full water bottle, and a cozy bed of wood shavings. And it gets even better when the FuzzyBoy 360 exercise wheel arrives. Now Seymour's day is filled with activity and the delicious yogurt drops brought to him by Little Girl. He couldn't want for anything more, right? Wrong. When a wily cat starts talking about the wonders of the sunroom filled with yogurt drops, the gullible hamster escapes the cage to discover what he's missing. What he discovers is a dog, the cat, and an "enormous monster" called Hoover that is very dangerous to small rodents. Bowers's representational artwork captures the life of a hamster well, and the facial expressions of the animals will delight young readers. There's lots of white space and the text and pictures flow well, allowing readers to absorb the action. This title should hit the mark, especially in classrooms in which hamsters are in residence.-Sharon Grover, Hedberg Public Library, Janesville, WI&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

Call me back immediately!&#x201d;<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t say anything more. He didn&#x2019;t have to: I knew just from the sound of his voice that something had happened to one of our boys.<br><br>It felt as if it took hours for my shaking fingers to dial our home phone number. Panic crashed over me like a wave; my heart pounded in my ears. Our youngest son, Dylan, was at school; his older brother, Byron, was at work. Had there been an accident?<br><br>Tom picked up and immediately yelled: &#x201c;Listen to the television!&#x201d; But I couldn&#x2019;t make out any distinct words. It terrified me that whatever had happened was big enough to be on TV. My fear, seconds earlier, of a car wreck suddenly seemed tame. Were we at war? Was the country under attack?<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s happening?&#x201d; I screamed into the receiver. There was only static and indecipherable television noise on the other end. Tom came back on the line, finally, but my ordinarily steadfast husband sounded like a madman. The scrambled words pouring out of him in staccato bursts made no sense: &#x201c;gunman . . . shooter . . . school.&#x201d;<br><br>I struggled to understand what Tom was telling me: Nate, Dylan&#x2019;s best friend, had called Tom&#x2019;s home office minutes before to ask, &#x201c;Is Dylan home?&#x201d; A call like that in the middle of the school day would have been alarming enough, but the reason for Nate&#x2019;s call was every parent&#x2019;s worst nightmare come to life: gunmen were shooting at people at Columbine High School, where Dylan was a senior.<br><br>There was more: Nate had said the shooters had been wearing black trench coats, like the one we&#x2019;d bought for Dylan.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to alarm you,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d said to Tom. &#x201c;But I know all the kids who wear black coats, and the only ones I can&#x2019;t find are Dylan and Eric. They weren&#x2019;t in bowling this morning, either.&#x201d;<br><br>Tom&#x2019;s voice was hoarse with fear as he told me he&#x2019;d hung up with Nate and ripped the house apart looking for Dylan&#x2019;s trench coat, irrationally convinced that if he could find it, Dylan was fine. But the coat was gone, and Tom was frantic.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m coming home,&#x201d; I said, panic numbing my spine. We hung up without saying good-bye.<br><br>Helplessly fighting for composure, I asked a coworker to cancel my meeting. Leaving the office, I found my hands shaking so uncontrollably that I had to steady my right hand with my left in order to press the button for my floor in the elevator. My fellow passengers were cheerfully chatting with one another on the way out to lunch. I explained my strange behavior by saying, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s been a shooting at Columbine High School. I have to go home and make sure my son&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d; A colleague offered to drive me home. Unable to speak further, I shook my head.<br><br>As I got into the car, my mind raced. It didn&#x2019;t occur to me to turn on the radio; I was barely keeping the car safely on the road as it was. My one constant thought, as I drove the twenty-six miles to our home: Dylan is in danger.<br><br>Paroxysms of fear clutched at my chest as I sifted again and again through the same jagged fragments of information. The coat could be anywhere, I told myself: in Dylan&#x2019;s locker or in his car. Surely a teenager&#x2019;s missing coat didn&#x2019;t mean anything. Yet my sturdy, dependable husband had sounded close to hysterical; I&#x2019;d never heard him like that before.<br><br>The drive felt like an eternity, like I was traveling in slow motion, although my mind spun at lightning speed and my heart pounded in my ears. I kept trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together so it would come out okay, but there was little comfort to be found in the meager facts I had, and I knew I&#x2019;d never recover if anything happened to Dylan.<br><br>As I drove, I talked out loud to myself and burst into uncontrollable sobs. Analytic by nature, I tried to talk myself down: I didn&#x2019;t have enough information yet. Columbine High School was enormous, with more than two thousand students. Just because Nate hadn&#x2019;t been able to find Dylan in the chaos didn&#x2019;t necessarily mean our son was hurt or dead. I had to stop allowing Tom&#x2019;s panic to infect me. Even as terror continued to roll over me in waves, I told myself we were probably freaking out unnecessarily, as any parent of an unaccounted-for child would in the same situation. Maybe no one was hurt. I was going to walk into our kitchen to find Dylan raiding our fridge, ready to tease me for overreacting.<br><br>I nonetheless couldn&#x2019;t stop my mind from careening from one terrible scenario to another. Tom had said there were gunmen in the school. Palms sweaty on the wheel, I shook my head as if Tom were there to see. Gunmen! Maybe no one knew where Dylan was because he had been shot. Maybe he was lying injured or dead in the school building&#x2014;trapped, unable to get word to us. Maybe he was being held hostage. The thought was so awful I could barely breathe.<br><br>But there was, too, a nagging tug at my stomach. I&#x2019;d frozen in fear when I heard Tom mention Eric Harris. The one time Dylan had been in serious trouble, he&#x2019;d been with Eric. I shook my head again. Dylan had always been a playful, loving child, and he&#x2019;d grown into an even-tempered, sensible adolescent. He&#x2019;d learned his lesson, I reassured myself. He wouldn&#x2019;t allow himself to get drawn into something stupid a second time.<br><br>Along with the dozens of other frightening scenarios whirling through my fevered brain, I wondered if the horror unfolding at the school might not be an innocently planned senior prank, spun terribly out of hand.<br><br>One thing was for sure: Dylan couldn&#x2019;t possibly have a gun. Tom and I were so adamantly anti-gun, we were considering moving away from Colorado because the laws were changing, making it easier to carry concealed firearms. No matter how hideously ill-conceived the stunt, there was no way Dylan would ever have gotten involved with something involving a real gun, even as a joke.<br><br>And so it went, for twenty-six long miles. One minute I was awash with images of Dylan hurt, wounded, crying out for help, and then I&#x2019;d be flooded with happier snapshots: Dylan as a boy, blowing out his birthday candles; squealing with happy pleasure as he rode the plastic slide with his brother into the wading pool in the backyard. They say your life flashes before you when you die, but on that car ride home, it was my son&#x2019;s life flashing before me, like a movie reel&#x2014;each precious frame both breaking my heart and filling me with desperate hope.<br><br>That hellish ride home was the first step in what would become a lifetime&#x2019;s work of coming to terms with the impossible.<br><br>� � �<br><br>When I arrived home, my panic kicked into an even higher gear. Tom told me what he knew in spotty bursts: shooters at the school, Dylan and Eric still unaccounted for. Whatever was happening was serious. He&#x2019;d called our older son, Byron, who&#x2019;d said he would leave work and come to us immediately.<br><br>Tom and I raced around the house like demented wind-up toys, flooded with adrenaline, unable to stop or to complete a task. Our wide-eyed pets crouched in the corners, alarmed.<br><br>Tom was single-minded in his focus on the missing coat, but I was personally confounded by Nate saying Dylan had missed bowling. He&#x2019;d left the house that morning with more than enough time to get there; he&#x2019;d said good-bye as he left. Thinking about it, I found myself haunted by the peculiar nature of that farewell.<br><br>That morning, the morning of April 20, my alarm had gone off before first light. As I dressed for work, I watched the clock. Knowing how much Dylan hated to get up early, Tom and I had tried to talk him out of signing up for a 6:15 a.m. bowling class. But Dylan prevailed. It would be fun, he said: he loved bowling, and some of his friends were taking the class. Throughout the semester, he&#x2019;d done a good job of getting himself to the alley on time&#x2014;not a perfect record, but nearly. Still, I needed to keep an eye on the time. No matter how dutifully he set his alarm, on bowling mornings Dylan usually needed an extra call-out from me at the bottom of the stairs to get him out of bed.<br><br>But on the morning of April 20, I was still getting dressed when I heard Dylan bounding heavily down the stairs, past our closed bedroom door on the main floor. It surprised me that he was up and dressed so early without prompting. He was moving quickly and seemed to be in a hurry to leave, though he had plenty of time to sleep a little more.<br><br>We always coordinated our plans for the day, so I opened the bedroom door and leaned out. &#x201c;Dyl?&#x201d; I called. The rest of the house was too dark for me to see anything, but I heard the front door open. Out of the blackness, his voice sharp and decisive, I heard my son yell, &#x201c;Bye,&#x201d; and then the front door shut firmly behind him. He was gone before I could even turn on the hallway light.<br><br>Unsettled by the exchange, I turned back to the bed and woke Tom. There had been an edge to Dylan&#x2019;s voice in that single word I&#x2019;d never heard before&#x2014;a sneer, almost, as if he&#x2019;d been caught in the middle of a fight with someone.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t the first sign we&#x2019;d had that week to indicate Dylan was under some stress. Two days before, on Sunday, Tom had asked me: &#x201c;Have you noticed Dylan&#x2019;s voice lately? The pitch of it is tight and higher than usual.&#x201d; Tom gestured toward his vocal cords with his thumb and middle finger. &#x201c;His voice goes up like that when he&#x2019;s tense. I think something may be bothering him.&#x201d; Tom&#x2019;s instincts about the boys had always been excellent, and we agreed to sit down with Dylan to see if something was on his mind. It certainly made sense that Dylan would be feeling some anxiety as his high school graduation loomed. Three weeks before, we&#x2019;d gone to visit his first-choice college, the University of Arizona. Though Dylan was highly independent, leaving the state for school would be a big adjustment for a kid who&#x2019;d never been away from home.<br><br>But I was unsettled by the tight quality I&#x2019;d heard in Dylan&#x2019;s voice when he said good-bye, and it bugged me that he hadn&#x2019;t stopped to share his plans for the day. We hadn&#x2019;t yet had the chance to sit down and talk with him, as Dylan had spent most of the weekend with various friends. &#x201c;I think you were right on Sunday,&#x201d; I told my sleepy husband. &#x201c;Something is bothering Dylan.&#x201d;<br><br>From bed, Tom reassured me. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll talk to him as soon as he gets home.&#x201d; Because Tom worked from home, the two of them usually shared the sports section and had a snack together when Dylan got back from school. I relaxed and continued to get ready for work as usual, relieved to know that by the time I arrived home, Tom would know if something was bothering Dylan. <br><br>In the wake of Nate&#x2019;s phone call, though, as I stood in our kitchen trying to piece together the fragments of information we had, I felt chilled by the memory of the nasty, hard flatness in Dylan&#x2019;s voice as he&#x2019;d said good-bye that morning, and the fact that he&#x2019;d left early but hadn&#x2019;t made it to class. I&#x2019;d figured he was meeting someone early for coffee&#x2014;maybe even to talk through whatever was bugging him. But if he hadn&#x2019;t made it to bowling, then where on earth had he been?<br><br>The bottom didn&#x2019;t fall out from my world until the telephone rang, and Tom ran into the kitchen to answer it. It was a lawyer. My fears so far had been dominated by the possibility that Dylan was in danger&#x2014;that either he&#x2019;d been physically hurt or done something stupid, something that would get him into trouble. Now I understood that Tom&#x2019;s fears also included something for which Dylan could need a lawyer.<br><br>Dylan had gotten into trouble with Eric in his junior year. The episode had given us the shock of our lives: our well-mannered, organized kid, the kid we&#x2019;d never had to worry about, had broken into a parked van and stolen some video equipment. As a result, Dylan had been put on probation. He&#x2019;d completed a Diversion program, which allowed him to avoid any criminal charges. In fact, he&#x2019;d graduated early from the course&#x2014;an unusual occurrence, we were told&#x2014;and with glowing praise from the counselor.<br><br>Everyone had told us not to make too much of the incident: Dylan was a good kid, and even the best teenage boys have been known to make colossally stupid mistakes. But we&#x2019;d also been warned that a single misstep, even shaving cream on a banister, would mean a felony charge and jail time. And so, at the first indication that Dylan might be in trouble, Tom had contacted a highly recommended defense attorney. While part of me was incredulous that Tom imagined Dylan could be involved in whatever was happening at the school, another part of me felt grateful. In spite of Tom&#x2019;s worry, he&#x2019;d had the foresight to be proactive.<br><br>I was still miles away from the idea that people might actually be hurt, or that they&#x2019;d been hurt by my son&#x2019;s hand. I was simply worried that Dylan, in the service of some dumb practical joke, might have jeopardized his future by carelessly throwing away the second chance he&#x2019;d been given with the successful completion of his Diversion program.<br><br>The call, of course, brought much, much worse news. The lawyer Tom had contacted, Gary Lozow, had reached out to the sheriff&#x2019;s office. He was calling back to tell Tom the unthinkable was now confirmed. Although reports were still wildly contradictory, there was no doubt something terrible involving gunmen was happening at Columbine High School. The district attorney&#x2019;s office had confirmed to Gary Lozow that they suspected Dylan was one of the gunmen. The police were on their way to our home.</p><h2>Nana Upstairs and Nana Downstairs (Picture Puffin Books)</h2><p>Tommy is four years old, and he loves visiting the home of his grandmother, Nana Downstairs, and his great-grandmother, Nana Upstairs.

Given its graceful treatment of a difficult subject, it has been a parental staple ever since, and a new generations of readers will be glad to discover this timeless tale in a lovely new edition. In an appended note, dePaola says he approached this project "as a completely new book." Thus, the format is larger than formerly, the pictures have been re-done in full color, and even the text has been slightly modified, though the story remains the same: every Sunday four-year-old Tommy's family goes to visit his grandparents. His grandmother is always busy downstairs, but his great-grandmother is always to be found in bed upstairs, because she is 94 years old. Tommy loves both of his nanas and the time he spends with them. He is desolate when his upstairs nana dies, but his mother comforts him by explaining that "she will come back in your memory whenever you think about her." Although dePaola's book is a nostalgic tribute to his own family, its theme--that not only people but our love for them survives in our memories--is universally true and important. <i>Michael Cart</i></p><h2>Unicorns Don&#39;t Give Sleigh Rides (The Adventures of the Bailey School Kids, No. 28)</h2><p>The 17th book from the hugely popular early chapter book series to re-emerge with a new look!

The book begins with the mother saying, "Look after the baby, Carl. I'll be back shortly." Let the adventure begin! Carl looks out the window to make sure Mom is gone. Once the coast is clear, the baby crawls out of the crib and onto Carl's back. First stop? Mom's bed. Second stop? The top of the dresser where powder puffs are sported as hats. The infant--now in Carl's capable paws--slides down the laundry chute, swims in the fish tank, dances, raids the refrigerator, and makes a huge mess. Carl dutifully bathes the baby, cleans up the chaos, puts his charge back in the crib, and plays it cool when Mom comes home. "Good dog, Carl!" she says upon her return. A sweet, subtly absurd picture book that jubilantly illustrates the old adage, "When the cat's away, the mice will play." <i>(Picture book)</i></p><h2>Same Sun Here</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Even better than reading a refreshingly honest story by one talented writer is reading one by two such writers.&#x201d; &#x2014;&nbsp;<i>Publishers Weekly</i>&nbsp;(starred review)</b><br><br>Pen pals Meena and River have a lot in common: fathers forced to work away from home to make ends meet, grandmothers who mean the world to them, and faithful dogs.

Licklider. He did not design the first personal computers or write the software that ran on them, nor was he involved in the legendary early companies that brought them to the forefront of our everyday experience. He was instead a relentless visionary that saw the potential of the way individuals could interact with computers and software. </b><br> <br>At a time when computers were a short step removed from mechanical data processors, Licklider was writing treatises on "human-computer symbiosis", "computers as communication devices", and a now not-so-unfamiliar "Intergalactic Network." His ideas became so influential, his passion so contagious, that Waldrop called him "computing's Johnny Appleseed. <br> <br>In a simultaneously compelling personal narrative and comprehensive historical exposition, Waldrop tells the story of the man who not only instigated the work that led to the internet, but also shifted our understanding of what computers were and could be.<br>Included in this edition are also the original texts of Licklider's three most influential writings: 'Man-computer symbiosis' (1960), which outlines the vision that inspired the personal computer revolution of the 1970s; his 'Intergalactic Network' memo (1963), which outlines the vision that inspired the internet; and "The computer as a communication device" (1968, co-authored with Robert Taylor), which amplifies his vision for what the network could become.</p><p>M. Mitchell Waldrop is a freelance writer and editor. He earned a PhD in elementary particle physics at the University of Wisconsin, and a Master s in journalism at Wisconsin. <br> <br>He was previously a writer and West Coast bureau chief for <i>Chemical and Engineering News</i> and senior writer at <i>Science</i>, editorial page and features editor at <i>Nature</i>, and worked in media affairs for the National Science Foundation. He is also the author of <i>Man-Made Minds</i> (Walker, 1987), a book about artificial intelligence and <i>Complexity</i> (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1992), a book about the Santa Fe Institute and the new sciences of complexity.<br><br> He lives in Washington, D.C. with his wife, Amy E. Friedlander.When people ask me about Xerox Parc, I always tell them about J. C. R. Licklider Lick and how he formed the ARPA Information Processing Techniques Office in 1962 and started the great research funding for interactive computing and pervasive worldwide networks that has resulted in most of the technology we use today: both via the inventions of the eventually 16 or so ARPA projects at various universities and think tanks, and by creating the next generations of computing researchers, many of whom became the founders and mainstays of Xerox Parc. The top book I recommend to read about this large process that stretched over 20 years is <i>The Dream Machine</i> by M. Mitchell Waldrop. It is the most accurate, has the most detail, and has the best organization and writing. He is able to admirably catch many of the most important parts of both the history and the spirit of the many headed research and engineering processes that together created our interactive networked information world. --Alan Kay<br><br>The Dream Machine works admirably as an exploration of the intellectual and political roots of the rise of modern computing. It s an ambitious and worthwhile addition to the history of science. --<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br>A masterpiece! A mesmerizing but balanced and comprehensive look at the making of the information revolution the people, the ideas, the tensions, and the hurdles.

It took Lucy Grealy twenty years of living with a distorted self-image and more than thirty reconstructive procedures before she could come to terms with her appearance after childhood cancer and surgery that left her jaw disfigured.

Her cheeks felt warm, then hot. Amy shook her short, light brown hair over her freckled face. She hoped it would hide her bright pink cheeks. At least I&#x2019;m not at school, Amy thought. I hate blushing in front of the whole class!<br> <br>In fact Amy wouldn&#x2019;t be back at her school, Santa Vista Elementary, for one whole week. It was the Friday night before spring break. Amy was in her bedroom with her best friends, Marion, Ellie, and Liz. They had a sleepover almost every Friday. This week, it was Amy&#x2019;s turn to host.<br> <br><br> <br>The girls were finishing up a game of MASH. Amy held up the paper that had made her blush. She pointed to the name of her future husband.<br> <br><br> <br>Liz, Marion, and Ellie squealed.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re so lucky, Amy!&#x201d; Ellie said, shaking her hands to dry her newly painted nails. Stewart was Liz&#x2019;s big brother. He was twelve. All the girls, except for Liz, thought he was the cutest.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lucky?&#x201d; said Liz. Marion was braiding Liz&#x2019;s wavy blond hair in front of the mirror. Liz wrinkled her nose. &#x201c;Who would want to marry my brother? Ew.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stay up too late tonight,&#x201d; Marion said. She wrapped a hair band around Liz&#x2019;s braid. &#x201c;Tomorrow my mom and I are taking Coco to a big horse show!&#x201d;<br> <br>Coco was Marion&#x2019;s brown purebred horse. Marion was a great rider. Together, Marion and Coco had won tons of blue ribbons! &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be out of town for most of the week,&#x201d; Marion added, her green eyes twinkling.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;Me too,&#x201d; said Liz. Liz and her family were going to the beach. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait! A whole week of sun, sand, and best of all, no homework!&#x201d; Liz flopped back onto Amy&#x2019;s bed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to bring my easel and paint box. I&#x2019;ll paint you each a sunset!&#x201d; Amy loved Liz&#x2019;s paintings. She was such a good artist!<br> <br>Ellie sighed and fluffed her red pillow. &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;ll be here in Santa Vista all week,&#x201d; she said, plopping down. Her tight black curls bounced over her headband. Ellie tossed her head dramatically. &#x201c;BOR-ing! But at least my Nana Gloria is coming to stay!&#x201d;<br> <br>Ellie&#x2019;s grandmother was moving in with her family. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s bringing over some boxes&#x2014;and her parrot, Lenny! I want to teach him a song. Then we can sing a duet!&#x201d;<br> <br>Ellie grabbed a pink hairbrush. She flicked on Amy&#x2019;s MP3 player. Singing along with a pop song, Ellie belted into her hairbrush microphone. Ellie always sang loudly and with feeling, like an actress on a stage.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;How about you, Amy?&#x201d; Ellie said. &#x201c;What are you going to do this week?&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>Amy&#x2019;s heart sank a little. Her friends all had somewhere to go or something to do. She didn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>Amy&#x2019;s parents were divorced and Amy lived with her mom in Santa Vista. Her dad lived in Orange Blossom, the next town over. Amy sighed as she remembered that she couldn&#x2019;t even go visit Dad this break because he was away on business.<br> <br>Amy shrugged. &#x201c;Read?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I do have a brand-new Nancy Drew book. Count the change in my piggy bank? Dust my sticker collection?&#x201d; Her friends giggled, but Amy was only half joking. What was she going to do?<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;I guess I&#x2019;ll help my mom at the clinic,&#x201d; Amy said. Amy&#x2019;s mom, Dr. Melanie Purvis, was a veterinarian. She ran a vet clinic in the house next door. Pets from all over Santa Vista came for their checkups. Other times, animals came when they were sick or hurt. Amy loved animals of all kinds. She also loved spending time at her mom&#x2019;s clinic.<br> <br>As if reading her mind, Amy&#x2019;s cat Milly crawled out from under the bed. She climbed into Amy&#x2019;s lap. &#x201c;Milly will keep me company. Right, Milly?&#x201d;<br> <br>Only seven days until next Friday&#x2014;their next sleepover. Then they would all be together again.<br> <br>Oh, well, thought Amy. Spring break can&#x2019;t last forever.<br> <br><br> <br></p><h2>Infreakinfertility: How to Survive When Getting Pregnant Gets Hard</h2><p><p><b><b>"This isn't a book about conquering infertility. This is a book about surviving it."</b></b></p><br><br><p>I felt like a babyless freak. No matter what we tried, I couldn&#x2019;t get pregnant, even after standing on my head after sex. I was pretty sure I was the only woman on the planet going through infertility, certainly the only one jamming needles into my butt on commercial breaks during my favorite TV shows. Everyone was getting pregnant around me and no one was talking about what happened if you couldn&#x2019;t.</p><p>After my experience, I wanted to write a book for other infertile women and couples who feel alone, the book I wish I&#x2019;d had when I was going through it, filled with dark humor and illustrations of quirky ovaries and whimsical sperm. If you&#x2019;re like me, you want blunt, honest conversations about all the crazy stuff you&#x2019;re going through with someone who&#x2019;s been there and understands at least some of what you&#x2019;re dealing with and how you&#x2019;re feeling. And if it can somehow give you permission to laugh without diminishing the pain you&#x2019;re feeling? Even better.</p><p>This is the <em>funnest</em> book you&#x2019;ll ever read about the worst thing that&#x2019;s ever happened to you. Each chapter covers a different challenge with infertility and is broken into sections, a little of my story and concerns, a blurb from my husband, Alex, kind of a window into his dudely brain, and practical tips on how to cope. Read it yourself, read it as a couple, and if you&#x2019;re struggling to explain your feelings to friends and family, hurl a copy at them and run away.</p><p>I really wish you didn&#x2019;t need this book, but since you do, come on over. <b>You&#x2019;re not alone</b>.</p></p><p></p><h2>Terrifying Tales to Tell at Night: 10 Scary Stories to Give You Nightmares!</h2><p><b>For the fans of <i>Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</i>, here comes a new illustrated children's horror anthology with works by Neil Gaiman, Sephen King, and more.

He lives in London, England.&#x201c;One of the great things about this book&#x2014;Stephen Jones&#x2019; one-hundred-and-fifty-first&#x2014;is the restraint shown. . . . Its subtlety and lack of &#x2018;over-the-top-ness&#x2019; is its real power. . . . The stories contained aren&#x2019;t even childish either&#x2014;the young readers are never condescended. Collectively they deal with some very grown-up issues indeed, such as the difficulties of family dynamics, death, loss, domestic violence, and how our childhood fears help shape who we become as adults . . . For that reason alone I found it a much more mature read than so much of the &#x2018;adult&#x2019; fiction out there today. . . . <b>A profound experience . . . spooky, creepy, multi-layered, <i>and</i>&nbsp;intellectual.</b> And that is what I believe most children really want when all is said and done&#x2014;to be respected and taken seriously. <i>Terrifying Tales to Tell at Night</i>&nbsp;does that with aplomb, as well as being thoroughly enjoyable into the bargain. . . . The wonderfully macabre illustrations by Randy Broecker&nbsp;only serve to make this book all the more enjoyable, bringing me back to that great place in my own childhood.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b><i>Phantasmagoria Magazine</i></b><br><br> "There is no doubt that<b></b>Stephen Jones is one of the very best anthologists working in the horror and fantasy fields now or in the past."<br><b>&#x2014;John Gilbert,&nbsp;<i>Phantasmagoria Magazine?</i></b><br><br> "[Stephen Jones is] one of the genre's most enthusiastic cheerleaders."&nbsp;<br><b>&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br> "[Jones is] horror's last maverick."&nbsp;<br><b>&#x2014;Christopher Fowler</b><br><br> "Stephen Jones . . . has a better sense of the genre than almost anyone in this country."&nbsp;<br><b>&#x2014;Lisa Tuttle,<i>&nbsp;The Times Books</i></b><br><br> "A new anthology from Stephen Jones is always an event."&nbsp;<br><b>&#x2014;Dennis Etchison</b><br><br> "WOW!

Intimately involved in her husband&#x2019;s political life, from the governorship of New York to the White House, Eleanor would eventually become a powerful force of her own, heading women&#x2019;s organizations and youth movements, and battling for consumer rights, civil rights, and improved housing. In the years after FDR&#x2019;s death, this inspiring, controversial, and outspoken leader would become a U.N. Delegate, chairman of the Commission on Human Rights, a newspaper columnist, Democratic party activist, world-traveler, and diplomat devoted to the ideas of liberty and human rights.</p><p>This single volume biography brings her into focus through her own words, illuminating the vanished world she grew up, her life with her political husband, and the post-war years when she worked to broaden cooperation and understanding at home and abroad.</p><p><em>The Autobiography of Eleanor Roosevelt</em> includes 16 pages of black-and-white photos.</p></p><p><p>A candid and insightful look at an era and a life through the eyes of one of the most remarkable Americans of the twentieth century</p><p>The long and eventful life of Eleanor Roosevelt (1884-1962) was full of rich experiences and courageous actions. The niece of Theodore Roosevelt, she married a Columbia University law student named Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who gradually ascended in the world of New York politics to reach the presidency in 1932. Throughout his three terms, Eleanor Roosevelt was not only intimately involved in FDR's personal and political life but also led women's organizations and youth movements, and fought for consumer welfare, civil rights, and better housing standards. During World War II she traveled with her husband to meet leaders of many powerful nations; after his death in 1945 she worked as a UN delegate, chairman of the Commission on Human Rights, newspaper columnist, Democratic Party activist, and diplomat, and was a world traveler. By the end of her life, Eleanor Roosevelt was recognized around the world for her fortitude and commitment to the ideals of liberty and human rights. Her autobiography constitutes a self-portrait no biography can match for its candor and liveliness, wisdom, tolerance, and breadth of view&#x2014;a self-portrait of one of the greatest American humanitarians of our time.</p><p>With 8 pages of black-and-white photographs and an afterword by Eleanor Roosevelt's granddaughter</p><p>Anna Eleanor Roosevelt was born in New York City on October 11, 1884. She married Franklin Delano Roosevelt on March 17, 1905, and was the mother of six children.

He has helped with my day-to-day nutrition in and out of fight camps, my weight-cut protocol, and my rehydration program for after weigh-ins, which to me are the most important. Chris doesn&#x2019;t only tell you what to eat and when to eat it, but he also breaks down how every person&#x2019;s body is different and reacts to certain foods different and he explains why I should eat certain foods and why eating them at a specific time is so important. Having him on my team absolutely gave me a tremendous advantage over my competition. I wouldn&#x2019;t trust anyone else with my diet.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014; Ryan LaFlare, retired UFC fighter</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been an athlete my entire life, but nutrition has always overwhelmed me. We live in a culture of fad diets. Consumers are taught to believe you need to starve in order to lose weight. As a result, the public, like me, gets overwhelmed and discouraged. We tend to starve ourselves to lose weight, and when we can&#x2019;t take it anymore, we binge. Chris&#x2019;s book has made it finally possible for me to break that cycle. I realize eating healthy doesn&#x2019;t mean I have to be hungry. It doesn&#x2019;t have to be boring. Not only do I notice a difference in my physical appearance, but the difference in my mood is also amazing. I can think clearer and feel generally happier just by finally finding a way to maintain healthy eating habits. I think this book serves value to not only those competing but also to anyone looking to make positive changes in their health!&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014; Sarah Thomas, 2018 New York Golden Gloves winner </b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Having known Chris and seeing the way he eats for a few years now, I&#x2019;ve seen with my own eyes the superhuman capabilities it gives someone when they get their nutrition on point.

Of EMILY WINDSNAP AND THE MONSTER FROM THE DEEP, she says, &#34;I always knew that Emily&#39;s story wasn&#39;t finished at the end of the first book. I really wanted to explore the idea of an island where humans and merfolk lived together in peace. I also knew that there was a detail I was missing. Then I happened to see an in-flight video about a theme park with a ride called the Kraken, and I instantly knew that this creature was the missing ingredient.&#34; Liz Kessler lives in England.We swam side by side to begin with. Below us, occasional shoals of parrotfish and bright red snappers swept across the sandy bed. When the channel narrowed, I swam ahead, slinking along the silent passageway. The ground soon became uncluttered: clear golden sand beneath us, the sun shining down, almost directly above our heads. Two silhouetted mermaid figures gliding along below the surface, our shadows came and went, appearing briefly before suddenly growing distorted with the splash of a tail breaking the water's still surface.<br><br>We came to the curtain of reeds draped down the channel's walls and the algae-coated wooden plaques. That's when the feeling started inside me. I didn't know what it was. A quivery kind of sensation jiggling around in my stomach. Nervous. Waiting for something - and a feeling that there was something waiting for me, too. Trying not to let Shona see my quivering hands, I parted the curtain and looked through the hole in the wall. The water sparkled and fanned out into a wide lagoon. Ferns hung down over cracks and gaps in the walls. A white tropical bird flew into a hole behind me, its long tail disappearing into the rock. Nothing else moved. Shona stared. <br> <br>I turned to her. "Ready?" My voice shook.<br><br>She broke her gaze to look at me. "Let's just get this over with."<br> <br>I glanced around to check that no one had followed us, then I squeezed through the gap and swam into the lagoon. The sun burned down, heating my neck and dancing on the water. Its light rippled below us in wavy lines across the sea floor.<br><br>As we slid across the stillness, the water grew colder and murkier. When the lagoon narrowed back into a channel, I couldn't see my reflection swimming along below me anymore. The walls lining our trail had lost their hardness. They were like chalk. I stopped and scraped my finger down the side. I made myself focus on the walls, almost flicking a switch to turn off the nagging wordless worry in my mind. Rock crumbled in my hand. The channel walls stretched upward, cold and gray and deserted. <br><br>"Emily!" Shona was pointing at something ahead. An engraving on the wall: a perfect circle with a fountain spiraling out from the center. It looked like a pinwheel, full of energy, almost as tall as us. I had this weird feeling I knew the picture, recognized it. Had I seen it in a book? Dreamed about it? What was it?<br><br>"Look at this!" Shona had swum ahead while I stared at the engraving.<br><br>I joined her in front of some ferns loosely covering a hole in the rock. The hole disappeared below the surface. We dived down. Under the water, it was just big enough to swim into.<br><br>"Cool!" I grinned at her. A secret tunnel reaching into the rock! "Shona, we have to see what's in there."<br>_______<br><br>EMILY WINDSNAP AND THE MONSTER FROM THE DEEP by Liz Kessler. Copyright � 2006 by Liz Kessler.

It boils down to heat and convenience. Which is best for you? A totally personal choice. Tadashi, who grills for his family almost every Sunday, three seasons a year, insists on charcoal for its purity of cooking and flavor. Harris also loves charcoal, but keeps a gas grill handy for hurry-up weeknight grilling. For this book, we stick to the two most popular grilling options for our recipes, kettle-style charcoal grills and gas grills, and base our timings on them. <br>&nbsp;<br><b>Charcoal grills</b> &nbsp;Not only do charcoal grills pump out a lot more heat than gas grills, they also surround foods with enveloping rays from the glowing coals, searing and cooking foods in a way gas grills just can&#x2019;t. And besides the high temperatures, charcoal, especially lump charcoal, produces a singular smoky flavor. With charcoal grills, though, you have to start a fire, maintain it, manage temperature, and clean up the ash. It&#x2019;s more work, but&nbsp; the challenge makes the results that much more rewarding.<br><br><b>Gas grills</b>&nbsp; No doubt about it, gas grills are much more convenient to use than charcoal grills and easier to control, and there&#x2019;s no messy ash to trash after dinner. And gas grills like the Weber we used in our book have special metal bars that vaporize dripping juices, thus adding flavor while eliminating flare-ups. <br><br><b>Kamado grills</b>&nbsp; We also want to mention charcoal-fueled kamado-style grills like the Big Green Egg. These are grills lined with high-fire ceramics or other types of earthenware that do a great job of retaining heat, so you can grill much hotter. They have a cultish following; as fans can attest, foods grilled on them turn out fantastic. If you do use an Egg or any other kamado-style grill for the recipes in this book, follow its user&#x2019;s guide to adjust recipe timing.<br><br><b>Charcoal</b>&nbsp; When grilling with charcoal, a good-quality lump hardwood charcoal is best. These irregularly shaped chunks of natural charcoal are 100 percent hardwood and contain no additives. They burn hotter and faster than charcoal briquettes, so cook foods better. Lump charcoal is more expensive than briquettes, but if it fits your budget, go with it. Otherwise, look for all-natural charcoal briquettes, which are not laced with additives like regular briquettes. <br><br><b>Chimney starter</b>&nbsp; With any type of charcoal, light the briquettes with a cylindrical chimney starter rather than lighter fuel, which infuses food with an unappealing, fuel-tinged flavor. You&#x2019;ll find them at any store that sells grilling equipment. <i>To use</i>: Pile charcoal into the top chamber and stuff crumpled newspaper into the bottom chamber, which has holes on the sides. Set the chimney starter on the lower grate of your grill (which holds the charcoal) and light the newspaper. The coals will ignite; when they&#x2019;re covered with gray ash, they&#x2019;re ready for cooking. (Chimney starters get very hot and must be handled safely. Be sure to fully read the user&#x2019;s guide that accompanies this tool before the first use.)<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Japanese Grills</b><br>Kettle and gas grills rule the American backyard. But Japanese use different kinds of grills that are also terrific and available here. First, let&#x2019;s dispel a myth: In Japan, hibachi aren&#x2019;t grills. There, they are cylindrical or box-shaped containers (earthenware or earthenware-lined) used for smoldering charcoal to heat a room. Somehow, in America, the word <i>hibachi</i> came to mean a small-sized grill or a flat-top griddle. Small Japanese grills are actually called <i>shichirin</i>. These grills are made from earthenware or ceramics; come in different sizes; and are cylindrical, square, or rectangular. Some are small enough to rest on a tabletop, which you see in restaurants in Japan. Charcoal-fired <i>konro</i> are larger grills, typically rectangular shaped, and made from heatproof ceramics or metal. These are the grills used at yakitori joints to sizzle perfect skewers of chicken; their narrow fireboxes concentrate and focus heat from the charcoal while at the same time insulating the hands that turn the skewers. <i>Konro</i> are perfect for Japanese skewer grilling (page 19) but also typically come with removable wire-mesh cooking grates, so you can use those as well. <i>Konro</i> are sold in various sizes; a 54-centimeter version (about 21 inches) is perfect for home use, and, as we can personally attest, an incredible way to grill foods (see &#x201c;Sources,&#x201d; page 177 , for retailers). With all these Japanese grills, you don&#x2019;t use typical American charcoal, lump or not. Instead, you burn binchotan, an almost magical, artisan-made Japanese charcoal (see &#x201c;Binchotan,&#x201d; page 12).&nbsp;<br><br><b>INDISPENSABLE TOOLS</b><br>No matter how kitted-out your charcoal or gas set-up, you need the right tools to grill successfully. You don&#x2019;t need a ton of stuff, just these indispensable tools:<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Grill brush</b>&nbsp; A heavy duty, steel-bristled brush will let you scrape off the gunk that accumulates on your cooking grate. Use it before and after you grill so foods won&#x2019;t stick. Preheat the grill, then brush the cooking grate like you mean it.<br><br><b>Oil wad</b>&nbsp; This one&#x2019;s a DIY (do-it-yourself) tool&#x2014;either a wad of paper towels or an old kitchen towel. It works in tandem with the grill brush to ensure that food won&#x2019;t stick. Dunk the wadded paper or towel in a small container of vegetable oil (1/2 cup is fine). Preheat the grill, then scrape the cooking grate with your grill brush. Now grab the oil-soaked wad with tongs and completely coat the cooking grate with oil. It might get a little smoky when you oil the grate, but don&#x2019;t worry, that will dissipate quickly. <br><br><b>Tongs</b> &nbsp;Buy a pair of sturdy, 16-inch-long steel tongs to safely turn foods on the grill without burning yourself (and also do the oil-wad trick described before). Use tongs, not a monster fork, to turn foods; you don&#x2019;t want to pierce your precious (and expensive) steak or chop and let all its luscious juices run out. <br><br><b>Kitchen chopsticks</b>&nbsp; Called saibashi in Japanese, these super-sized kitchen chopsticks (14 inches long and up) are incredibly handy for turning delicate or small ingredients on the grill&#x2014;scallops or spears of asparagus, for example. You can find these inexpensive wood or bamboo chopsticks at Japanese food markets.<br><br><b>Spatula</b>&nbsp; A spatula is critical for flipping fish fillets, burgers, or any other delicate foods that can break apart on the grill. Use a spatula with a blade at least 6 inches long. An all-metal spatula, the kind that does yeoman&#x2019;s work on the kitchen stove, is great. If you&#x2019;re grilling fish fillets, keep two handy, which makes turning easier. <br><br><b>Basting brush</b>&nbsp; We baste like nobody&#x2019;s business in this book, so a sturdy basting brush is a must. The best choice is a natural boar-bristle brush with a long handle that will keep your hand safely away from the heat. Make sure to hand-wash these brushes in hot, soapy water after each use. Avoid nylon bristles as they can melt if they touch the grate. An alternative is a brush with silicone bristles, as silicone can withstand higher temperatures.<br><br><b>Spray bottle</b>&nbsp; Keep a water-filled spray bottle handy to kill flare-ups before they scorch and blacken your food.<br><br><b>Hand fan</b>&nbsp; Use a sturdy hand fan or paddle fan two ways: to fan coals when you start your fire so they reach grilling temperature quicker and to fan coals when they&#x2019;re losing power, to revive them with a blast of oxygen-rich air.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Binchotan</b><br>Made from the branches of Japanese oak, <i>binchotan</i> is a revered, traditional white charcoal. While the word dates back to the 1700s, charcoal-making in Japan reaches back over a millennium and has played a central role in Japanese cooking since. What makes <i>binchotan</i> so special? Produced by artisans following the laborious methods handed down through the generations, the oak is fired in an earthen kiln for about a week, producing charcoal so hard it clinks like glass when struck together. <i>Binchotan</i>, which still keeps the natural shape of the branches from which it&#x2019;s derived, burns for hours, smokeless and odorless, at a whopping 1,800&#x2da;F. It&#x2019;s an integral element of <i>chanoyu</i>, the Japanese way of tea, where it&#x2019;s used for ritualistically heating the water. It is also essential for Japanese grilling because the very action of its intense infrared rays creates umami flavor compounds in ingredients&#x2014;so just grilling something on binchotan makes it taste better. The best <i>binchotan</i> comes from one tiny area in Japan, the Kishu region of Wakayama Prefecture, and is expensive; only certain oak of a certain age can be used, and few charcoal artisans plying this trade remain. But pricy or not, <i>binchotan</i> is the charcoal of choice for chefs devoted to grilling. Because it&#x2019;s so hard, lighting <i>binchotan</i> is tough; you have to place it over a live fire to ignite it. Once lit, it often takes an hour or more for the charcoal to become coated with white ash and reach cooking temperature. But because it burns so long, you can <i>very</i> carefully transfer red-hot <i>binchotan</i> from a grill to a <i>hikeshi tsubo</i> (fire-extinguishing pot), a special earthenware jar that will hold and eventually extinguish the charcoal, so you can use it again and again, until it reduces to dust.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>MANAGING HEAT </b><br>Managing heat on a stovetop is easy: just adjust the burner&#x2019;s controls this way or that and choose cookware like copper or cast iron to improve heat retention. Managing heat on the grill, on the other hand, is a whole different ballgame. On the grill, of course, you&#x2019;re dealing with direct flames, so you have to know how to do two things. First, you have to gauge temperature using either &#x201c;hand over fire&#x201d; technique or a grilling temperature (see &#x201c;Temperature Chart,&#x201d; below). And second, depending on the recipe, we grill one of three ways: direct, two-zone, or indirect.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Flare-Ups</b><br>When fat drips from foods and hits red-hot coals, the fat smokes&#x2014;then flares. These mini-fires can spell disaster for the grill, coating ingredients with black soot or scorching them beyond repair. A cover helps fight flare-ups by cutting off oxygen; otherwise use these two methods: First, leave enough room on the grill to shift foods. As soon as there&#x2019;s a flare-up, move an ingredient to another part of the grill while the flare-up burns out. Another option is to spray down those flames with a water-filled spray bottle. (You can do both options concurrently, of course.) Either way, you want to grill on coals, not shooting flames, so tamp down flare-ups right away. <br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>Grill Marks</b><br>The gorgeous crosshatched grill marks that you see on the meat, chicken, and fish photographed for this book were created by Tadashi, who did the grilling for the pictures, and who is a pro chef. But with a little practice, home cooks can also sear these distinctive marks on the foods they prepare. Here&#x2019;s how: Sear your ingredient for about 1 minute. Now, without flipping, give the ingredient a quarter turn (so it shifts 90 degrees). When it&#x2019;s time to flip the ingredient , repeat this process on the other side. Grill marks aren&#x2019;t a must, but they do make foods look pretty&#x2014;and mouthwatering. <br>&nbsp;<br><b>Secrets to Great Grilling<br></b>Here are the ten most important things to keep in mind when grilling:<br>1. Know thy grill. Your particular grill might be smaller or larger than the ones we used to test our dishes, or it could be a Big Green Egg. Adjust timing accordingly. Test for doneness when your food looks done. <br>2. Marinate with a flat-bottomed vessel. Use a baking dish, sheet pan, or even a plate to marinate. A flat bottom provides more surface area than a bowl, so the ingredients will better absorb the marinade. <br>3. Make sure the coals are hot. For charcoal grills, don&#x2019;t start grilling until the charcoal is fully lit, glowing, and covered in a fine gray ash. Use a hand fan to hasten this process. <br>4. Preheat your grill. Make sure the grill&#x2014;and especially the cooking grate&#x2014;is adequately preheated before starting to grill. Preheat the grate for at least 5 minutes. For a gas grill, close the cover to preheat. <br>5. Brush and oil the cooking grate every time. Repeat: brush and oil your cooking grate every time you grill to keep food from sticking to the grate. We can&#x2019;t emphasize this enough. <br>6. Keep the vents open. For charcoal grills, make sure the vents on the bottom and cover are open to allow oxygen to fuel your fire. Also, make sure the vents on the bottom aren&#x2019;t clogged, so air can get in. <br>7. Use the cover strategically. We&#x2019;ll tell you which foods must be grilled covered. The cover traps heat, so thick cuts of meat cook evenly, and also cuts the flow of oxygen, reducing flare-ups.<br>8. Add more coals. Keep the temperature consistent by adding more charcoal to the grill before the fire gets too weak. After coals burn for about 1 hour, it&#x2019;s time to replenish. For gas grills, always keep an extra tank on hand so you don&#x2019;t run out.<br>9. Keep your grill clean. Brush the cooking grate after grilling, while it&#x2019;s still hot. When the grill cools, scoop out the leftover ash. For gas grills, clean the briquettes or lava rocks once they cool and keep the gas jets unclogged. Wipe down the grill regularly with soap and water.<br>10. Remember, grilling is an art. That&#x2019;s the fun and beauty of it. When you&#x2019;re cooking over fire, you&#x2019;re really cooking&#x2014;that&#x2019;s why we love grilling! So use your judgment: remember, the recipes in our book are guidelines. Grill according to your gut, your equipment, your ingredients, and your environment (grilling in Denver, the Mile High City, say, requires more time than grilling in Death Valley).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>CLASSIC YAKITORI</b><br>SOUL FOOD, COMFORT FOOD, DRINKING FOOD&#x2014;yakitori is all this and more. The word literally means &#x201c;grilled bird,&#x201d; but yakitori can also include beef, pork, duck, and veggies. No matter which ingredients you use, yakitori is always bite-sized pieces, impaled on skewers, and grilled over fire, preferably one fueled with Japanese binchotan (see &#x201c;Binchotan,&#x201d; page 12). Chicken remains the primary ingredient for yakitori&#x2014;some old school joints serve nothing but&#x2014;prepared either seasoned with salt or basted with <i>tare</i> (pronounced &#x201c;tar-eh&#x201d;), or sauce. But the <i>tare</i> isn&#x2019;t brushed on willy-nilly. The secret to great yakitori is grilling the chicken partway, coating with the sauce, and then grilling the coated chicken. So you grill both the chicken and the sauce. This one-two punch is the reason why yakitori comes out double-caramelized and so lip-smacking delicious. And it&#x2019;s why yakitori is one of the most popular and beloved foods in Japan.<br>&nbsp;<br>Although there were references to it some two hundred years earlier, yakitori really caught the fancy of the general population in the nineteenth century when Japan reopened to the West and its citizens began consuming meat again (see &#x201c;Meat in Japanese Cooking,&#x201d; page 2). Interestingly, the most prized meat at that time was chicken, not beef, and high-end &#x201c;chicken cuisine&#x201d; restaurants began popping up all over Japan, es...</p><h2>When I Grow Up</h2><p><p><strong>Grammy Award winner and pop culture icon &#x201c;Weird Al&#x201d; Yankovic delivers his first picture book, bringing his trademark wit, wordplay, and silliness to a story that explores the timeless question &#x201c;What do you want to be when you grow up?&#x201d; Funny and charming, this is a celebration of creativity and possibility.&nbsp; </strong></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month!

I think chronologically that was sometime after I wanted to design miniature golf courses but before I wanted to be a writer for <em>MAD</em> magazine. I&#x2019;ll guess that was about the time when I wanted to be a fireworks-maker. Thankfully I didn&#x2019;t blow any fingers off.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the weirdest job you&#x2019;ve ever had?</p> <p><strong> Yankovic:</strong> I was an accordion repo man. During my summer breaks from college, I had a job giving accordion lessons to kids at a local music school. The kids usually didn&#x2019;t own their own accordions, so we had to lend the instruments out . . . for as long as they were still taking lessons. If they ever <em>stopped</em> taking lessons and <em>didn&#x2019;t</em> return the instrument, it was a job for . . . Accordion Repo Man!</p> <p>Actually, it wasn&#x2019;t all that difficult&#x2014;usually they were more than happy to hand the accordions back.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Kids talk about being &#x201c;grown up&#x201d; a lot. Heck, we all do. What does it mean to be &#x201c;grown up&#x201d;?</p> <p><strong>Yankovic:</strong> I think it somehow involves the ability to grow hair in disgusting places.</p> <p>Being &#x201c;grown up&#x201d; obviously means different things to different people. To most folks, I assume the definition has something to do with the added responsibilities of adulthood and the ability to make more important decisions about one&#x2019;s own life. Growing up is an important transition, and hopefully a very positive one&#x2014;although, strangely, whenever somebody told me to &#x201c;Grow up!&#x201d; as a kid, it was rarely meant as loving, constructive advice.</p> <p>Of course, if you define &#x201c;growing up&#x201d; as having to jettison every last shred of one&#x2019;s childlike wonder of the world . . . well, then I hope I <em>never</em> grow up.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> At one point Billy ponders becoming an &#x201c;artist who sculpts out of chocolate mousse.&#x201d; That sounds scrumptious . . . and hard! If you could sculpt something out of mousse, what would you create?</p> <p><strong>Yankovic:</strong> Well, of course, I&#x2019;d make the mousse into a moose! What else? I mean, I hate to be obvious, but I just can&#x2019;t resist homonyms...</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you have any advice for kids who are already thinking about what to be when they &#x201c;grow up&#x201d;?</p> <p><strong>Yankovic:</strong> Hey, it&#x2019;s a terrific thing to think about. By all means, explore your options. Find your passions in life. And always remember: It&#x2019;s never too late to change your mind.</p><blockquote><em>'Cause maybe I'll be a gorilla masseuse<br>Or an artist who sculpts out of chocolate mousse<br>Or a rodeo clown or a movie director<br>Or maybe professional pickle inspector...<br></em></blockquote><p>Billy's classmates may have never considered careers in snail training or sumo wrestling before, but by the time the exuberant eight-year-old is done cataloging his dream jobs, they just might share his belief in unlimited potential! </p><p>Virtuoso wordplay, irresistible rhythm, and laugh-out-loud humor abound in the first picture book by the one and only "Weird Al" Yankovic. This unbridled celebration of creativity and possibility invites readers of all ages to consider afresh what they want to be when they grow up.</p></p><h2>The Didache: The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles</h2><p>The Didache means &#x201c;The Teaching&#x201d; &#x2013; Christian traditions has claimed that &#x201c;The Teaching&#x201d; is nothing less than the teaching of the Twelve Apostles to the early-Church. The Didache was considered by many in the early-Church as part of the New Testament. It fell out of the New Testament as time passed, but continued to serve as a Christian manual. The Didache was lost for centuries until 1873, when a Greek manuscript was rediscovered. The Didache serves as an important historical document in the early-Church, as well as providing solutions to practical Church questions such as does a person have to be dunked during baptism, or can water simply be poured over the head? This copy has been translated by R. Joseph Owles from the Greek into every day, contemporary language, and is formatted in a way that makes it easy to both read and understand.</p><p></p><h2>4 Chair Discipling: What Jesus Calls Us to Do (Like Jesus Series)</h2><p><p>Dann Spader is a&nbsp;disciple-maker who has spent his adult life exploring what it means to take someone from being a seeker to making disciples themselves.

("What if that pencil one day disappeared? I'd fold up the paper till stories appeared.") As she continues to imagine her the disappearance of her supplies, she invents new ways to create, by chiseling wood, drawing in the dirt, and using leaves, snow, and sand as her media. As more and more resources are withdrawn, the child makes shadows, tells stories, and dances. Until "If I had nothing, but still had my mind; there would always be stories to seek and to find." The story's origins are events from the author's own life. Berger shares in the notes that she wondered how she would be able to create when she was forced out of her home by a flood. She improvised, and in doing so realized that those who are "compelled to create...will always find a way." Curato was inspired by Berger, and reflects that in digital collages of household and found objects offset with charming pen-and-ink drawings of the young protagonist. The story is sandwiched between two exterior depictions of the narrator's apartment building. At the start of the book, she can be seen through a window, working at her desk. At the end of the book, the windows illuminate all the creators nearby; a man playing violin, a woman decorating a cake, and singers, dancers, painters, and needle workers.

He finds the perfect opportunity when a "princess" lands in front of him, apparently from the land of Punk, as her Punk Princess t-shirt implies.

Yet here he was, in the middle of a cave&#x2014;a dark and stupid cave&#x2014;on his way to do just that. This was all such a waste of time, and after that last fight with what was apparently supposed to be a troll, his arm really hurt.<br> <br>From deep within the cave came what was probably supposed to be a bloodcurdling roar. Jack sighed, rolled his eyes, and slowed down to wait. A roar like that could only mean bad things . . . and sure enough, a ball of fire came burning down the corridor, exploding just a few inches from his left arm. The heat caused him to jerk his body to the right, saving him from the second fireball, which blew through the spot he&#x2019;d just been standing in.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; Jack yelled indignantly. &#x201c;You almost hit me!&#x201d; Without waiting for a reply, he dropped to his knees, yanked out the blunt prop sword he&#x2019;d been given, and whipped it end over end toward the source of the fireballs.<br> <br>A second later Jack heard a dull thunk, followed by a groan and what sounded like a body hitting the cave floor. He smiled, then helped himself to his feet and continued on, the corridor now thankfully free of fireballs. As he walked, he looked himself over, realizing with annoyance that somewhere along the line his tan shirt and pants had both been ripped. Perfect. As if he had that many clothes to begin with.<br> <br>A bit deeper in, a bright green dragon mask lay on the floor in two separate pieces, split by the otherwise completely useless sword. Just past the mask was an unconscious boy dressed all in green, a deep red bruise spreading over his face. Apparently, Jack&#x2019;s aim had been better than he thought.<br> <br>He briefly felt bad about knocking the boy out, but then remembered how close the fireballs had come, and all guilt disappeared. Picking up his prop sword, Jack started to leave when a thought stopped him in his tracks: Why play by the rules?<br> <br>There it was, on the boy&#x2019;s right hand: a sparkling red ring. Jack quickly worked the ring off the boy&#x2019;s finger, then slid it onto his own. Satisfied, he started back down the hall, trying to ignore the growing ache in his shoulder. Stupid fake troll. At least the fake dragon had missed.<br> <br>A bit farther in, torches flickered on the cave walls, creating what would have been an eerie effect if it hadn&#x2019;t been so transparently designed to be. Again, Jack slowed down, moving as silently as he could despite the sword banging against his leg at every step. As the torchlight grew brighter and the cave started to widen, Jack stopped completely.<br> <br>This was it . . . the final challenge. The first challenge required a strong arm, he&#x2019;d been told, though if the pain in his shoulder was any indication, his arm hadn&#x2019;t exactly been up to it. The second challenge took a brave heart, facing the fireballs. And the final challenge, the most difficult of all, could only be won by a wise head.<br> <br>Wise, huh? This might not end well.<br> <br>Still, it couldn&#x2019;t hurt to get a little information before rushing in. Jack drew his sword and angled it around the corner. In the sword&#x2019;s reflection, he saw two torches hanging from the ceiling over an old, blackened stone altar. Strapped to the altar was what looked to be a teenage boy in a white dress, a golden tiara decorating his blond hair.<br> <br>A boy playing the princess? Classy.<br> <br>Over the boy in the dress stood a man wearing all brown, holding a knife to the boy&#x2019;s chest. On the other side of the room, a hunched old woman leaned against a large staff. The woman&#x2019;s black robe covered everything but her wart-infested nose, which looked more like a carrot than anything.<br> <br>&#x201c;My knight will rescue me,&#x201d; Jack heard the boy princess on the altar say in an unnaturally high-pitched voice. &#x201c;He will! Just you wait!&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack sighed. A knight? Yikes. He fiddled with the ring a bit to ready it, then prepared himself to move quickly, knowing he was going to need the element of surprise if he had any hope of saving the boy . . . princess . . . whatever.<br> <br>&#x201c;The knight is here,&#x201d; the woman in black hissed.<br> <br>Okay, apparently surprise was out. Still, even if they knew he was there, maybe Jack could still throw them a bit.<br> <br>&#x201c;I am here,&#x201d; Jack said, stepping out from around the corner. &#x201c;But . . . I surrender.&#x201d; With that, he held his sword up, then slowly placed it on the ground.<br> <br>&#x201c;You what?!&#x201d; the wart-covered woman said.<br> <br>&#x201c;You what?!&#x201d; the boy princess said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I surrender,&#x201d; Jack repeated, stepping away from the sword. &#x201c;You win.&#x201d;<br> <br>The man in brown held the knife closer to the fake princess. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s some kind of trick,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>The woman nodded. &#x201c;I agree. Cut out the princess&#x2019;s heart!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; the boy princess screamed, his voice breaking in panic.<br> <br>&#x201c;Quiet, princess!&#x201d; the man in brown said, lifting his knife high into the air. &#x201c;The witch orders, and I obey!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And as for you, little hero,&#x201d; the witch said, &#x201c;you will join your princess in death!&#x201d; With that, she aimed a gnarled wand in Jack&#x2019;s direction, shouted a magic word, and shot a bolt of lightning straight at him.<br> <br>Jack dropped, then quickly dodged a second blast by rolling to the right.<br> <br>&#x201c;Princess, your heart is mine!&#x201d; the man in brown screamed, driving the knife down toward the boy on the altar.<br> <br>&#x201c;I have you now!&#x201d; the old woman shouted, aiming her wand right at Jack.<br> <br>Jack glanced quickly between the woman and the man in brown. He could either save himself or the princess, there was no time to do both. He instantly made his decision, aimed the ring, and fired it . . .<br> <br>Right at the witch.<br> <br>A fireball three times the size of the previous ones erupted from the ring and exploded into the witch&#x2019;s chest, lighting her black robe on fire. The witch screamed in terror as she frantically tore at her flaming clothing. The man in brown gasped, then rushed to the witch&#x2019;s side, dropping his knife to the ground as he ran.<br> <br>Jack used the distraction to retrieve his sword, then duck under the altar to quickly cut through the captive boy&#x2019;s bonds. &#x201c;Get up, Princess!&#x201d; he hissed, standing back up. &#x201c;We have to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>And then he stopped, realizing he was too late. The boy princess&#x2019;s white gown was now stained with some kind of red liquid, and he lay on the altar with his tongue sticking out, not moving.<br> <br>Dropping his sword to the ground, Jack put his head in his hands. He had failed. The princess was dead.<br> <br>The furious witch grabbed Jack by his shirt and pushed him against the wall, her eyes narrowed dangerously and her fake nose singed. &#x201c;Jack!&#x201d; she roared. &#x201c;You could have killed me!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know, I&#x2019;m sorry!&#x201d; he said, his face turning red. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know it would do that! When Stephen used the ring, the fireballs were a lot smaller. . . .&#x201d; He quickly removed the magic ring and held it out to the woman. She glared at him for a second before grabbing it from his hand. Then she smacked him in the head.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care what Stephen did,&#x201d; Julia, his teacher, told him as she tore off the rest of her makeup. &#x201c;He knew enough to miss you! You, on the other hand, aimed right at me!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, ow, first of all!&#x201d; Jack said, rubbing his head. &#x201c;Second of all, you said to treat this test like it was real. And you were shooting lightning at me! What was I supposed to do?!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Um,&#x201d; said the princess from the altar, &#x201c;can someone rescue me already?&#x201d; The princess&#x2019;s voice had gotten remarkably deeper since she &#x201c;died.&#x201d; Jack took a closer look and recognized Bertrand, one of the other boys from the village. Apparently Jack had missed some of the ropes, and Bertrand&#x2019;s arms were still tied down.<br> <br>Jack rolled his eyes. &#x201c;Rescue yourself,&#x201d; he said, tossing his fake sword to the &#x201c;princess.&#x201d; It hit the boy in his stomach, knocking the wind out of him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, congratulations, Jack,&#x201d; Julia said as she finished removing her costume. &#x201c;You failed. Not only did you handle every single situation wrong&#x2014;every single one!&#x2014;but you went after me when the real threat was the witch&#x2019;s servant. He killed the princess, Jack!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But you were attacking me!&#x201d; Jack protested. &#x201c;If I had saved her, I would have died. And then what good would I have been to either of us?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And what good were you now?&#x201d; Julia asked as the man in brown, Jack&#x2019;s teacher Stewart, quietly walked over to untie the still complaining princess.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all useless anyway,&#x201d; Jack said, his face burning from his failure. &#x201c;We all know there are no unmarried princesses left. Even if there were, I don&#x2019;t want to marry anyone, let alone some stuck-up royal. I&#x2019;m just fine where I am!&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack turned to leave, but Julia grabbed his arm. &#x201c;This is important, Jack. You&#x2019;re the son of a . . . well, a . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A criminal?&#x201d; Jack said, his eyes narrowing.<br> <br>&#x201c;And I don&#x2019;t want you to follow his lead,&#x201d; Julia said. &#x201c;This is for your own good! Being a hero, rescuing a princess, killing a dragon . . . these could really turn your life around! At least, if you survive long enough.&#x201d; She glared at him. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the only one in your entire class to fail the princess rescue test. Just go home, Jack. We&#x2019;ll talk about this later.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack sighed, and turned to leave. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care how the world works,&#x201d; he said over his shoulder. &#x201c;All this? It isn&#x2019;t me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And it never will be at this rate,&#x201d; Julia said, helping Stewart to yank the ropes off the fake princess.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks for nothing, Jack!&#x201d; the &#x201c;princess&#x201d; yelled at him, his wig and tiara falling off as he sat up.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a pretty dress, Bertrand,&#x201d; Jack said as he left. &#x201c;Your mother must be so proud.&#x201d;<br> <br>The walk back through the cave was a bit more peaceful this time, though that wouldn&#x2019;t last long. His grandfather would be waiting, and Jack&#x2019;s test results weren&#x2019;t going to go over too well.<br> <br>Outside, the brightly setting sun blinded him for a moment. He raised a hand up to block it, as the green trees of summer weren&#x2019;t helping too much in that regard. He realized that it wouldn&#x2019;t be much longer before the trees picked themselves up and migrated to the warmer south, leaving their dead, leafless brothers behind.<br> <br>Lucky trees.<br> <br>Between those trees, an old man tapped his foot impatiently. Jack&#x2019;s grandfather was covered in three or four layers of different-colored clothing, while his long white beard poked out from his shirt in several places. None of that was out of the ordinary, though. The tiny, golden girl sitting on his grandfather&#x2019;s shoulder, however, was a bit unusual. The girl&#x2019;s wings shimmered in the sunlight as she flapped them absently.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hi, Grandpa,&#x201d; Jack said, hoping a smile would help hide his failure. &#x201c;New friend?&#x201d;<br> <br>His grandfather snorted, then gently offered his palm to the fairy on his shoulder. The creature daintily stepped into it, smiling shyly up at Jack as his grandfather walked over. &#x201c;Just caught that bully Robert hunting some of these things,&#x201d; the old man said. &#x201c;The other three flew off when I rescued them, but this one seems to have a thing for me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Before he could even finish speaking, though, the fairy jumped out of his hand and flew over to Jack. She landed on his head, settled herself into his hair, and let out a contented sigh.<br> <br>&#x201c;Or not,&#x201d; his grandfather said with a grunt. &#x201c;How did the test go?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack took in a deep breath, then blew it out without a word.<br> <br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; said his grandfather, nodding. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t say I&#x2019;m surprised. What was the problem this time?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack turned red. &#x201c;I kinda let the princess die.&#x201d;<br> <br>His grandfather groaned. &#x201c;You do realize that&#x2019;s not a good thing, right?&#x201d; the old man asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;So I&#x2019;m told,&#x201d; Jack said.<br> <br>His grandfather patted him on the shoulder. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll save her next time. Until then, you&#x2019;ll practice every minute that you&#x2019;re not working in the fields.&#x201d;<br> <br>And there it was, pretty much the worst punishment his grandfather could have laid down. The last thing Jack wanted to do was practice more princess rescuing. The whole thing was just so useless!<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not useless,&#x201d; his grandfather said, apparently reading his mind. &#x201c;You think I&#x2019;m going to let my only grandson stay a farmer for the rest of his life? That&#x2019;s a job for kids too young or adults too old to go out on a proper adventure. Now, let&#x2019;s get back to the cottage. There&#x2019;s a chill in the air.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You realize it&#x2019;s the middle of summer, right?&#x201d; Jack asked as they started home. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m pretty sure any chill is just in your head.&#x201d;<br> <br>That earned Jack a whack on the head from his grandfather&#x2019;s cane. &#x201c;I fought an ice giant, you little idiot!&#x201d; the old man snapped. &#x201c;The monster froze my bones to their very core, and they&#x2019;ve never properly healed! Usually it&#x2019;s worse when I&#x2019;m around the truly stupid.&#x201d; He gave Jack a dark look. &#x201c;You see where I&#x2019;m going with this.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll start a fire when we get home,&#x201d; Jack said with a sigh. On top of his head, the fairy made herself a little nest, tugging some of his hair in the process. Unlike this one, most fairies were shy, scared of humans for a good reason: Their wings sold pretty well to wizards and witches for their magic. The practice was horribly cruel, but that didn&#x2019;t stop some of the village boys from hunting the little fairies.<br> <br>&#x201c;A fire&#x2019;s a start,&#x201d; the old man said. &#x201c;And then tomorrow we&#x2019;ll go over my adventuring lessons again.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack gritted his teeth. &#x201c;Grandpa, I&#x2019;m not going to waste my time anymore!&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not you . . . and I&#x2019;m definitely not my father. What&#x2019;s the point, anyway? There aren&#x2019;t any unmarried princesses left!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And how would you know?!&#x201d; his grandfather shouted back. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not even looking! If you go looking for adventure, it will find you! At least, it would if you had the brains nature gave your little fairy friend&#x2014;the one who&#x2019;s scratching her head with her foot, I might add.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If adventure&#x2019;s going to find me,&#x201d; Jack growled angrily, &#x201c;it can find me right here. If you&#x2019;re right, it shouldn&#x2019;t matter where I am. I should be able to just stick out my arms and have a princess fall right into them!&#x201d;<br> <br>He stuck out his arms to highlight how stupid his grandfather&#x2019;s argument was.<br> <br>Above him, a circle of blue fire exploded open in the middle of the air. Out of the middle of the flaming circle, a person fell to the ground less than a foot from Jack&#x2019;s outstretched arms.<br> <br>For a second, both Jack and his grandfather were too shocked to say anything.<br> <br>As usual, though, his grandfather recovered first.<br> <br>&#x201c;You really have to work on your aim, boy,&#x201d; the old man said.<br> <br>Jack quickly ran forward to see if the person&#x2014;a girl&#x2014;was hurt. She was lying on her stomach, so Jack quickly turned her over, sighing in relief when he saw she was still breathing. He looked her over, trying to figure out if she&#x2019;d broken anything, but she seemed okay . . . that was, other than her odd appearance.<br> <br>The strangest thing had to be the streak of startling blue playing through the girl&#x2019;s dirty blond hair. That couldn&#x2019;t have been natural; some sort of magic had to have been involved. Not that her clothing was normal, either. Her pants were dark blue, worn through in some places but almost new in others. Her black shirt was a much thinner material than her pants and barely had any sleeves. And then Jack saw something that made him gasp in surprise.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; his grandfather asked, creeping up behind Jack to look. &#x201c;Is it dead?&#x201d;<br> <br>The old man noticed what Jack had seen, and he leapt into the air, almost giddy with excitement. &#x201c;Jack, my boy!&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve done it, you&#x2019;ve found one!&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack shook his head, still staring at the girl. She couldn&#x2019;t be . . . could she?

State. Ever.: A Florida Man Defends His Homeland</h2><p><b>A <i>New York Times </i>bestseller&#x2014;a brilliantly funny exploration of the Sunshine State from the man who knows it best: Pulitzer Prize winner Dave Barry.</b> <br><br>We never know what will happen next in Florida. We know only that, any minute now, something will. Every few months, Dave Barry gets a call from some media person wanting to know, &#x201c;What the hell is wrong with Florida?&#x201d; Somehow, the state's acquired an image as a subtropical festival of stupid, and as a loyal Floridian, Dave begs to differ. <br><br>Join him as he goes in hunt of the legendary Skunk Ape; hobnobs with the mermaids of Weeki Wachee Springs; and visits Cassadaga, the psychic capital of the world, to have his dog's aura read (apparently, she's "very spiritual"). Hitch a ride for the non-stop thrills of alligator-wrestling ("the gators display the same fighting spirit as a Barcalounger"), the hair-raising spectacle of a clothing-optional bar in Key West, and the manly manliness of the Machine Gun Experience in Miami. <br><br>It's the most hilarious book yet from &#x201c;the funniest damn writer in the whole country&#x201d; (Carl Hiaasen, and he should know). By the end, you'll have to admit that whatever else you might think about Florida&#x2014;you can never say it's boring.</p><p>From 1983 to 2004, <b>Dave Barry</b> wrote a weekly humor column for <i>The Miami Herald</i>, which in 1988 won a Pulitzer Prize for Commentary. He is the author of more than thirty books, including such bestsellers as the nonfiction <i>Live Right and Find Happiness (Although Beer Is Much Faster)</i>, <i>You Can Date Boys When You're Forty</i>, and <i>I'll Mature When I'm Dead</i>; the novels <i>Big Trouble</i>, <i>Tricky Business</i>, and <i>Insane City</i>; the very successful YA Peter Pan novels (with Ridley Pearson); and his Christmas story <i>The Shepherd, the Angel, and Walter the Christmas Miracle Dog</i>. Two of his books--<i>Big Trouble</i> and <i>Dave Barry's Guide to Guys</i>--have been turned into movies. For a while, his life was even a television series, <i>Dave's World</i>, but then it was canceled. The series. Not the life. For many years, Dave was also a guitarist with the late, infamous, and strangely unlamented band the Rock Bottom Remainders.<b>A Brief History of Florida <br><br>For millions of years, Florida was uninhabited, because it was geographically remote, not to mention several hundred feet beneath the surface of the Atlantic, which meant insurance rates were very high. Gradually, however, Global Rising caused Florida to emerge from the ocean, and today the state is above sea level except during certain months.<br><br>The first humans arrived in Florida twenty thousand&nbsp;years ago, having crossed the land bridge from Asia and&nbsp;made the arduous trek across North America in search of Spring Break. These early inhabitants left primitive archaeological -artifacts that can still be seen today, including the world&#x2019;s oldest-known stone bong.<br><br>In time, the population of Florida started to grow&#x2014;-probably, scientists now believe, as a result of people having sex&nbsp;with each other. Eventually, these indigenous peoples spread out across Florida and formed Native American tribes, including the Tequestas, Mohicans, Cheyennes, Seminoles, Gators, Presbyterians and Kansas City Chiefs. These tribes established thriving, sophisticated societies based on hitting things with rocks until they became edible. Sometimes the tribes would fight wars, but after maybe fifteen minutes they would stop because of the humidity.<br><br>Thus Florida was a prosperous and peaceful place until the early sixteenth century when the first Europeans arrived in the form of Spanish explorers who had been lured by the legend of the <i>P�jaro Temprano</i>, which told of a mythical place where, if you were seated before 4:30 p.m., you got a steeply discounted entr�e. The Spaniards named the new land <i>La Pascua de la Florida</i> (literally, &#x201c;The Sunshine State&#x201d;) and claimed it for Spain, seeing as how there was nobody there except for several hundred thousand natives.<br><br>In 1763, Spain and England decided to end the Seven Years&#x2019; War because it started in 1756 and they couldn&#x2019;t agree on a new name for it. In the peace settlement, Spain gave Florida to England as part of a package that also included 167 trillion mosquitoes. England, seeking to link Florida with its colonies to the north, erected a two-hundred-mile-long line of orange highway-construction barrels, which can still be seen today.<br><br>For the next two decades, English settlers attempted to engage in agriculture, which mainly consisted of fending off alligators with hoes. Finally in 1783, England said the hell with it and gave Florida back to Spain, reserving the right for English citizens to return on holiday and lie on the beach until their skin was the color of Hawaiian Punch.<br><br>Meanwhile, to the north, the United States was forming.&nbsp;The Spanish authorities tried to keep the Americans out of&nbsp;Florida, but settlers from Georgia kept coming across the border and erecting primitive log Waffle Houses. Eventually,&nbsp;Spain gave up and tried to give Florida back to England, which, of course, refused, as did France, Germany, Poland, Switzerland, Australia, Egypt, Japan and the Republic of Fiji. Finally, in 1821, Florida became an American territory, which it remains to this day in many areas.<br><br>At first there were land disputes between the U.S. government and the Native American tribes, but these were eventually settled via a treaty under which the government got the land and the tribes got to leave. In 1845, Florida became the twenty-seventh state in the union, choosing Tallahassee as its capital, which got a good laugh from the other states because Tallahassee is located in Alabama.<br><br>In those days, the Florida economy was strictly agricultural, with the main crop being cotton, which was grown on large plantations and gathered into bales, which were then transported to seaports, where they were thrown away because of mildew. This was hard work, but much of the labor was provided by slaves, who were always willing to lend a helping hand in exchange for not being beaten to death.<br><br>In 1865, the Civil War broke out, although Florida did not find out about it until 1883, when it was too late to really get&nbsp;involved. Meanwhile, the state&#x2019;s farmers had given up on cotton and were growing oranges, which were popular in the Northern states. One fateful day, a Florida farmer decided, as a prank, to ship up some grapefruit. At the time, nobody in Florida considered grapefruit to be edible; it was used exclusively as a weapon. But, incredibly, Northerners actually <i>ate</i> it, apparently believing that anything tasting that bad must be healthy. This marketing breakthrough paved the way for such &#x201c;health foods&#x201d; as tofu, which is actually a waste by-product of the manufacture of linoleum, and&nbsp;&nbsp;quinoa, which gets its name from the Bolivian word for &#x201c;gravel.&#x201d;<br><br>January 1, 1900, marked the dawn of the twentieth century, although because of a broken telegraph wire Florida did not find out about this until July 18, 1903. For the next decade or so, the state remained fairly isolated, although it played a&nbsp;pivotal role in World War I on November 10, 1918, when American biplanes&#x2014;in an action that was widely condemned by international human-rights organizations&#x2014;dropped several dozen grapefruit on Germany, which surrendered immediately.<br><br>World War I was followed by the Roaring Twenties, a time when Americans went to speakeasies, where they drank bathtub gin until they were so impaired that they believed it would be a sound financial strategy to invest, sight unseen, in real estate located at or below sea level in a tropical -cyclone zone. This resulted in the first Florida Land Boom, during which Miami went from being a sleepy village to a thriving metropolis, until the Hurricane of 1926 turned it back into a sleepy village, but with a lot more kindling.<br><br>This was followed by the Great Depression, which was very bad in Florida.<br><br>q: How bad was it?<br><br>a: Some families resorted to eating grapefruit.<br><br>The only ray of economic hope during the thirties was the&nbsp;growth of Florida&#x2019;s tourism industry, which was boosted by the construction of such &#x201c;only in Florida&#x201d; attractions as Alligator World, Alligator Land, Alligator Swamp, Alligator Jungle, Alligator Jamboree, Alligator Rodeo, Alligato-Rama and Alligators Out the Wazoo. These attractions consisted of -alligators&#x2014;some of which were clearly deceased&#x2014;lying motionless in odiferous muck for days at a time. But tourists flocked to them anyway, because back then people were a lot stupider than they are today. (This also explains the popularity of the yo-yo.)<br><br>The next major event was World War II, during which Florida, once it found out what was going on, was totally on the American side.<br><br>In 1956, the federal government began work on the Interstate Highway System, an ambitious project intended to realize the dream that someday, thanks to a vast network of safe, well-engineered, high-speed roads, Americans in formerly isolated communities would be able to get into their cars and, within a matter of hours, stop at a random exit to pee.

You can spend a day here and never hear any language but Spanish.<br><br>I head west on the Trail to Krome Avenue, which is just a&nbsp;few miles from Calle Ocho in linear space but light-years away in ambience. Across Krome, the world changes, quite suddenly, from city to swamp. This is the edge of the Everglades, Miami&#x2019;s vast, wild, weird backyard.<br><br>For many decades, most people&#x2014;most white people, anyway&#x2014;-viewed the Everglades as a waste of space, a bug--infested bog to be drained and turned into something useful. We now know, of course, that the Everglades are a unique, precious, fragile and irreplaceable wetlands ecosystem. But I&#x2019;ll be honest: This place has always kind of creeped me out. Strange things live out here; strange things happen out here.<br><br>For example: On the northwest corner of the Krome Avenue intersection, just inside the swamp, is a three-hundred-room hotel/casino resort operated by the Miccosukee Indian Tribe. One day in 2007, police received a report that two men were breaking into cars in the parking lot. Police responded and caught one of the men. The other ran away and dove into a nearby pond. That was a poor decision: This particular pond happened to be the residence of a large alligator, known to the resort staff as &#x201c;Poncho.&#x201d; The next day divers recovered what was left of the man fifty feet underwater.<br><br>I know some pretty crazy things have happened in Las Vegas, but I doubt that anybody on a Vegas casino property was ever eaten by an alligator.<br><br>Poncho is not alone: There are a couple of hundred thousand gators in the Everglades, and maybe a billion bullfrogs.&nbsp;There are also panthers out there, and bears, all kinds of birds, and God knows how many snakes, including Burmese pythons just about long enough to be used, if you could straighten them out, for first-down measurements.<br><br>And there&#x2019;s exotic human wildlife in the Everglades. There are poachers out there, and smugglers, and other well-armed people who seriously&#x2014;I mean, <i>seriously</i>&#x2014;value their privacy. There are fugitives hiding for one reason or another, lying low&nbsp;in a place where it&#x2019;s famously easy to disappear. There have been hidden commando bases out there where, for decades, various paramilitary groups&#x2014;some known to the U.S. government, some not&#x2014;trained for secret missions. There are stories of Indian burial sites where the ground is littered with artifacts worth a fortune, just lying around for the taking, if you could find them, which you can&#x2019;t.<br><br>This is an inadequate list of the elements that make the Everglades weird. It&#x2019;s safe to say that there are many more strange things going on out there that very few people know about, or ever will.<br><br>So, what with the combination of wildlife and weirdness, I have never viewed the Everglades as a place where I want to hang out. I have viewed it as a big flat space to be driven across as quickly as possible, much like Nebraska, but with a funkier aroma. When I&#x2019;m crossing the &#x2019;glades, I crank up the car radio and zip along at 70, 80, 90 miles an hour, my only interaction with the unique, precious, fragile and irreplaceable wetlands ecosystem around me coming in the form of flying insects the size of cocker spaniels splatting on my windshield.<br></b></p><h2>The Botanical Bible: Plants, Flowers, Art, Recipes &amp; Other Home Uses</h2><p><i>The Botanical Bible</i> is an elegant and comprehensive introduction to the beauty, diversity, and value of the botanical world.

A pioneer in the integration of health and medicine, he was the fitness expert for Good Morning America and was contributing editor to <i>Women's Sports and Fitness</i> and <i>Allure</i> magazines. </p><p><b> Introduction </b></p><p> This is not the first book ever written that concerns itself with the anatomical structures that are involved in exercise, nor is it intended to be the final word. It is not meant to be an exhaustive exploration of exercise vocabulary either. This book takes a unique and comprehensive stance on the anatomy of exercise, useful to laymen and professional alike. </p><p> Predominately, books that have included exercises with anatomical representations, whether or not they included instructions for performing the exercises, were targeted at two groups of readers: body builders and scientists. What I've tried to do with this book is to make this kind of information accessible and useful to anyone who exercises, including bodybuilders and scientists. To that end, this book includes exercise types typically overlooked in similar works, such as aerobic activities, stretches, and stability work. Moreover, this book takes into consideration the ways in which the body's systems depend on one another to generate movement. </p><p> In other texts of this nature, exercises have for the most part been depicted as using a specific muscle group because the book was intended to show how to develop size or strength in that particular muscle or group. Unfortunately, what often doesn't get mentioned is how the adjacent muscles and structures, as well as some that are not directly or obviously involved, contribute to the exercises and subsequent improvement. Hip and spine position, for instance, contribute to almost every major exercise and are integral not only to the proper biomechanics of a given movement, but the subsequent improvement of the targeted muscle. </p><p> For each exercise, the muscles indicated in the illustrations are identified as the ones that are primarily involved in the movement, whether they are active or stabilizing. Active or primary muscles are defined as those that contract to move a structure, while stabilizing muscles are defined as those that either co-contract, or, by their activation, stabilize either the primary or a secondary structure to allow movement. In a push-up, for instance, the primary active muscles act to extend the elbow and adduct the humerus (upper arm) at the shoulder joint. Primary stabilizers act to ensure that the elbow and shoulder joints remain steady and track properly; however, without the contraction of the deep spinal and pelvic musculature, as well as anterior leg musculature that contract to keep those joints stable and allow the ankle joint to act as a fulcrum, the movement is not possible. </p><p> The contribution of the secondary stabilizers varies in degree, depending on the movement. For example, in a barbell curl, since the weight is in front of the body and is translated in a curvilinear fashion that creates a greater forward lever and subsequent need for stabilization as it moves upward, the back and hip muscles become more relevant with regard to movement contribution. If the movement could simply not be performed without the contribution of these muscles, they were included. </p><p> The point here is to make the reader aware that during any given movement, some muscles that may not play a major role in the actual execution may still be necessary contributors for proper biomechanics and form while the exercise is being performed. The basic method I used to determine this was to ask whether or not the movement could be performed if the secondary stabilizers were injured, but readers should be aware that the specifics are open to some debate. </p><p> There is an enormous amount of variation that can be made to these exercises, since for any one single exercise there are perhaps four or five different ways to alter the stimulus (by changing the grip, foot position, altering the speed of the movement, and so forth). I have included some of these variations for many of the exercises. </p><p> This book contains the basic exercise vocabulary that any program can, and should, be built around, whether you are an elite athlete, a raw beginner, or are suffering from an injury. The specific exercises to use as well as intensity (the weight used, when relevant), volume (number of sets and repetitions), duration (time per session), and frequency (sessions per week) will all be determined by your own specific capacities and goals. The best and most effective way to determine these things is to consult a professional in the fitness/wellness/strength training profession for a program and prescription that suits your unique abilities and objectives. </p><p> The text is laid out in a structure that mimics the progression of a typical workout. While the text encompasses all of the elements pursuant to a comprehensive workout, it is not intended to be prescriptive in any way. The best use of this book is as a reference manual for understanding both positioning and muscular involvement for the included exercises, and should stimulate some thought, when performing a given exercise, about how the rest of your body plays a part in any particular movement. </p></p><h2>Dragon Ball Z (VIZBIG Edition), Vol. 9 (9)</h2><p>Change your perspective: get BIG<br><br>Reads R to L (Japanese Style), for A audiences. <b>Final Volume!Change Your Perspective--Get BIGA Collection of Volumes 25 - 26!</b><b>Final Battle!</b>Earth's days are numbered indeed!

I know: I&#x2019;ve been there, time and time again. For many people, when you don&#x2019;t feel like making dinner, you just order takeout. Or you go out. Or you defrost something from the freezer. But what about those of us living with food allergies or food intolerances? Just picking up the phone and ordering Chinese food is not an option. So, most often, we have to cook, even when we really don&#x2019;t feel like it. This book, comrades, is for you. It&#x2019;s a collection of seventy- five allergy-free but flavor-full meals that can be whipped up in thirty minutes or less, to help simplify your complicated life. As a working mother, I know that most nights the last thing I want to do is spend an hour or more preparing dinner. I just don&#x2019;t have the time, energy, or inspiration. But like it or not, I&#x2019;ve&nbsp; got a food-allergic household, and something safe, healthy, and delicious has got to land&nbsp; on that table.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#x2019;ve often thought, &#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t it be great if someone came up with a guidebook for day-to-day allergy-free cooking?&#x201d; I&#x2019;ve also spent many years asking my readers what recipes they miss most. This book is that guidebook, and a collection of those recipes, all designed to answer the most frequent request of all: &#x201c;Make it fast, make it simple!&#x201d; These seventy-five completely allergy-free meals will take&nbsp; the guesswork out of meal planning for you.&nbsp; These are the foods you love. Comfort foods.&nbsp; Not weird food, just good food that is also allergy-free; every recipe is free of gluten, dairy, eggs, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, and sesame, so you don&#x2019;t have to make substitutions. And all without the slightest sacrifice of taste or texture. In fact, I&#x2019;ve been told by those with no food restrictions that these recipes&nbsp; are better than the &#x201c;originals.&#x201d; So, whatever your allergies or intolerances, there&#x2019;s something in here for you. And all cooked up in thirty minutes or less.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In this book, I share my favorite secrets for turning allergenic recipes into allergy-free cuisine. There is an alchemy to allergy-free cooking; I&#x2019;ve spent ten years refining my understanding of it, and here, I teach you the magic behind the mystery. I&#x2019;ll teach you how to take rice milk and brown rice flour and transform it into a cream sauce. How to take olive oil and rice milk and transform it into an egg. I know most of you can make a salad allergy-free, but wouldn&#x2019;t you love to be able&nbsp; to make creamy mac &#x2019;n&#x2019; cheese without wheat, gluten, dairy, or soy? My last book, the Allergen-Free Baker&#x2019;s Handbook, taught people how to bake without wheat, eggs, and dairy, the three mainstays of traditional baking. This book&nbsp; will teach you how to make grilled cheese without cheese, pizza without wheat, and pesto without nuts, just to name a few. With these recipes, you&#x2019;ll be eating all your family favorites again in no time. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This collection of beloved recipe classics is for the fifteen million Americans living with food allergies. In the United States, one out of every thirteen kids under the age of eighteen has a food allergy. This book is also for the estimated 30 percent of Americans living with gluten intolerance, and the one in a hundred living with celiac disease. We have a lot of mouths to feed safely.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wrote this book for you, and for me. Because like you, my circumstances dictate that I must cook something safe and healthy, whether I feel like it or not. <br> My son Lennon was diagnosed with severe multiple food allergies at four months old. He outgrew his dairy and soy allergies by the time he was six. However, he was then diagnosed with shellfish, tree nut, and kiwi allergies, which I&#x2019;m assuming are for life. My other son, Monte, has allergic asthma and must avoid dairy when it flares; he was also diagnosed with a shellfish allergy last year. I myself have fish, shellfish, tree nut, wheat, and a variety of fruit allergies. My husband is dairy-allergic&nbsp; and gluten-intolerant. And so, we continue&nbsp; to eat allergy-free. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now, I&#x2019;m a foodie, but as my kids have grown older, and the homework load has gotten intense, and I am working around the clock, and my husband is often somewhere else, working just as hard, I don&#x2019;t have time to cook the way I used to. I will not be making slow-braised short ribs, or lamb that has to marinate for two days. Like you, I want quick and easy recipes that taste good. And of course I need them to be healthy and allergy-free, too. So I wrote the book I needed but couldn&#x2019;t find. <br> Allergy-Free and Easy Cooking is for those learning to cook and those who love to cook. It&#x2019;s also for you if you hate to cook but have to: hopefully, it will help you like it a little better.<br> &nbsp;<br><b> SunButter Dan Dan Noodles</b><br> &nbsp;<br> When my kids were very small, we lived in Westchester County, New York. My husband and I used to&nbsp; go on date night to a Chinese restaurant in Yonkers called Hunan Village. It was owned by a regal Chinese man named Paul. He was the most impressive host. He liked to order for our table, and it was thanks to him that I first tried dan dan noodles. I&#x2019;ve eaten them many times at restaurants since, and none compares to&nbsp; the ones at Hunan Village. They had the best darn dan dan noodles I&#x2019;ve ever tasted. Funny thing about that restaurant was my husband had been going to it ever since he was a kid, and Paul was the owner, all the way back then.

Right on time, Rosemary Dempsey thought ruefully as she opened her eyes and stirred. Whenever she had a big day ahead she would inevitably wake up in the middle of the night and start worrying that something would go wrong.<br> <br>It had always been like this, even when she was a child. And now, fifty-five years old, happily married for thirty-two years, with one child, beautiful and gifted nineteen-year-old Susan, Rosemary could not be anything but a constant worrier, a living Cassandra. Something is going to go wrong.<br> <br>Thanks again, Mom, Rosemary thought. Thanks for all the times you held your breath, so sure that the birthday upside-down cake I loved to make for Daddy would flop. The only one that did was the first one when I was eight years old. All the others were perfect. I was so proud of myself. But then, on his birthday when I was eighteen, you told me you always made a backup cake for him. In the single act of defiance that I can remember, I was so shocked and angry I tossed the one I had made in the garbage can.<br> <br>You started laughing and then tried to apologize. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that you&#x2019;re talented in other ways, Rosie, but let&#x2019;s face it, in the kitchen you&#x2019;re klutzy.&#x201d;<br> <br>And of course you found other ways to tell me where I was klutzy, Rosemary thought. &#x201c;Rosie, when you make the bed, be sure that the spread is even on both sides. It only takes an extra minute to do it right.&#x201d; &#x201c;Rosie, be careful. When you read a magazine, don&#x2019;t just toss it back on the table. Line it up with the others.&#x201d;<br> <br>And now, even though I know I can throw a party or make a cake, I am always sure that something will go wrong, Rosemary thought.<br> <br>But there was a reason today to be apprehensive. It was Jack&#x2019;s sixtieth birthday, and this evening sixty of their friends would be there to celebrate it. Cocktails and a buffet supper, served on the patio by their infallible caterer. The weather forecast was perfect, sunshine and seventy degrees.<br> <br>It was May 7 in Silicon Valley and that meant that the flowers were in full bloom. Their dream house, the third since they&#x2019;d moved to San Mateo thirty-two years ago, was built in the style of a Tuscan villa. Every time she turned into the driveway, she fell in love with it again.<br> <br>Everything will be fine, she assured herself impatiently. And as usual I&#x2019;ll make the birthday chocolate upside-down cake for Jack and it will be perfect and our friends will have a good time and I will be told how I&#x2019;m a marvel. &#x201c;Your parties are always so perfect, Rosie . . . The supper was delicious . . . the house exquisite . . . ,&#x201d; and on and on. And I will be a nervous wreck inside, she thought, an absolute nervous wreck.<br> <br>Careful not to awaken him, she wriggled her slender body over in the bed until her shoulder was touching Jack&#x2019;s. His even breathing told her that he was enjoying his usual untroubled sleep. And he deserved it. He worked so hard. As she often did when she was trying to overcome one of her worry attacks, Rosemary began to remind herself of all the good things in her life, starting with the day she met Jack on the campus of Marquette University. She had been an undergraduate. He had been a law student. It was the proverbial love at first sight. They had been married after she graduated from college. Jack was fascinated by developing technology, and his conversation became filled with talk of robots, telecommunications, microprocessors, and something called internetworking. Within a year they had moved to Northern California.<br> <br>I always wanted us to live our lives in Milwaukee, Rosemary thought. I still could move back in a heartbeat. Unlike most human beings, I love cold winters. But moving here certainly has worked out for us. Jack is head of the legal department of Valley Tech, one of the top research companies in the country. And Susan was born here. After more than a decade without the family we hoped and prayed for, we were holding her in our arms.<br> <br>Rosemary sighed. To her dismay, Susan, their only child, was a Californian to her fingertips. She&#x2019;d scoff at the idea of relocating anywhere. Rosemary tried to wrest her mind away from the troublesome thought that last year Susan had chosen to go to UCLA, a great college but a full five-hour drive away. She had been accepted closer to home at Stanford University. Instead she had rushed to enroll at UCLA, probably because her no-good boyfriend, Keith Ratner, was already a student there. Dear God, Rosemary thought, don&#x2019;t let her end up eloping with him.<br> <br>The last time she looked at the clock, it was three thirty, and her last impression before falling asleep was once again an overwhelming fear that today something was going to go desperately wrong.</p><h2>Creating Textures in Pen &amp; Ink with Watercolor</h2><p><p>Claudia Nice shows you how to turn ink and watercolors into the coarse-barked trunk of an oak, or the burnished smoothness of brass, or the verdant velvet of moss.

It&#39;s less important how quickly you lose weight, and more important how holistically you lose weight; you want your mind, your emotions, and your body to all &#39;lose weight.&#39; Weight that disappears from your body but not from your soul is simply recycling outward for a whilebut is almost certain to return. It&#39;s self-defeating, therefore, to struggle to drop excess weight unlessyou are also willing to drop the thought-forms that initially produced it and now hold it in place.&#34;- Marianne WilliamsonWhat is the connection between spirituality and weight loss? Best-selling author Marianne Williamson is about to answer that question for you in her groundbreaking new book, bringing you 21 spiritual lessons to help you surrender your weight forever. These lessons form a holistic paradigm for weight loss, addressing the spiritual, emotional, and psychological elements involved in what Williamson refers to as &#34;conscious weight loss.&#34; If you are a food addict, a compulsive eater, or someone who for any reason sees food as the enemy, this book is for you.A Course in Weight Loss addresses the true causal root of your weight-loss issues: a place within you where you have forgotten your divine perfection. This forgetfulness has confused not only your mind but also your body, making you reach for that which cannot sustain you . . . and reject that which does. As your mind reclaims its spiritual intelligence, your body will reclaim its natural intelligence as well.The 21 lessons in this book will take you on a deep, sacred journey. One step at a time, you will learn to shift your relationship with yourself-and your body-from one of fear to one of love. And you will begin to integrate the various parts of yourself-mind, body, and spirit-to become, once again, and in all ways, the beautiful and peaceful person you were created to be.As Williamson writes: &#34;When it comes to your enjoyment of eating, your best days are not behind you but ahead of you!&#34; So get ready to begin a new relationship with food . . . and with yourself.</p><p>Marianne Williamson is an internationally acclaimed lecturer and the best-selling author of A Return to Love, Healing the Soul of America, A Woman&#39;s Worth, Illuminata, Everyday Grace, The Gift of Change, and The Age of Miracles, among other works.

The school librarian leads the girl to the S volume of the animal encyclopedia, where she discovers the sloth, a creature that barely moves. When her sloth arrives, she names him Sparky, a moniker that suggests energy (unlike her new pet). The girl attempts to impose many un-sloth-like qualities on the quiet creature, playing several games with him that he is bound to lose (except for "Statue") and planning an elaborate Trained Sloth Extravaganza that is hardly eventful. While there are several attempts at humor in the text, ultimately this book is a little sad. The girl only reluctantly accepts that her pet sloth basically does nothing, and rather than embracing this quality, she finishes the book by starting a game of tag with her pet. Well-rendered watercolor and pencil illustrations in subdued hues of brown, green, and red depict a slight, spritely girl and an inexpressive sloth, and therein lies another problem with this book. Sloths are cute and huggable, but this one merely looks lost until the last page when he finally smiles a bit. For children interested in sloths, Lucy Cooke's A Little Book of Sloth (S &amp; S, 2013) is a much better choice, and it includes a reminder that "sloths belong in the wild and should never be kept as pets."

Unfortunately, what Lewis doesn't bank on is the fact that the previous owner of the mansion was also a wizard--but an evil one who has placed a tick-tocking clock somewhere in the bowels of the house, marking off the minutes until the end of the world. And when Lewis accidentally awakens the dead on Halloween night, the clock only ticks louder and faster. Doomsday draws near--unless Lewis can stop the clock!<p> This is a deliciously chilling tale, with healthy doses of humor and compassion thrown in for good measure. Edward Gorey's unmistakable pen and ink style (as seen in many picture books, including <i>The Shrinking of Treehorn</i> and <i>Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats</i>) perfectly complements John Bellairs's wry, touching story of a lonely boy, his quirky uncle, and the ghost of mansions past.

This makes it easy for anyone to breach your privacy online and, as a consequence, place your valuable assets at risk. Likewise, traditional business structures such as corporations and LLCs also fail the privacy test because your Secretary of State registrations are visible online for anyone to see.In THE UNCORPORATION, asset privacy expert James Billings reveals over 21 years of experience and research with elite clients on the use of anonymous business trusts for safety in a sensible, easy to understand language. This is the first time ever a concise, user-friendly guide on the use of business trusts is available to the public. Within these pages you will see why using a business trust rather than a state sponsored entity is the only way to anonymize title to your high value assets.Are you concerned about predatory lawsuits, hackers or nosy people looking for your business assets? Do you want freedom from government regulation? Then this book is for you.</p><p>TrustArte was founded in 2009 by James Billings, a highly respected global expert on "title" strategies for asset privacy. He educates individuals and businesses about the risks of visible assets in the public domain. Data search has forever changed because of the internet. Title strategies to anonymize your bank accounts, real estate, and business is our expertise. James earned his professional credentials in the fields of securities, aviation and real estate. He advised clients on sale transactions of high value assets. Vesting was always an important issue &#x2013; "James, how do we hold title to get maximum privacy and safety?" In 1995 a mentor taught James how ultra-sophisticated real estate investors hold title &#x2013; private trusts. These individuals demanded anonymity and freedom from secretary of state registrations. The uber wealthy are generally more concerned with taxes. Yet all business people with substantial assets are sensitive to privacy these days. This conclusively ended his recommending LLCs and Corporations for title. Thereafter only Realty Land Trusts held real property while Business Trusts held contracts and bank accounts. Once you understand the interplay of title law, real estate law, tax law, and trust law then apply a specific design the benefits are truly one of a kind. Rather than a toolbox, think of an artists palette. A trust is like a swiss army knife - nearly unlimited applications. James is known as the most sought after asset privacy consultant and expert for elite investors. He is famous for creating anonymous title to high value assets without lawyers or the government.

When she <br>asks for a pet, her handlers search high and low for the perfect companion.</p><p>Grade 1-4 The cover photo alone is all that is needed to "sell" this bookthe smallest, most delicate of kitten profiles in the massively careful embrace of a glistening gorilla, whose bare-knuckled fist is four times the size of the diminutive feline's head, and whose face radiates tenderness. Koko is one of a number of great apes in various experimental communication programs and is remarkably conversant in American Sign Language, used by hundreds of thousands of hearing-impaired people. With her linguistic skill, she asked for, and finally received, the small, tailless tabby kitten she promptly named All Ball. This brief, moving book records Koko's relationship with her pet. All Ball was groomed, played with, cuddled and loved, and never once showed fear of her large foster-mother, outlandish though she might seem to feline eyes. The growing relationship was cut horribly short by All Ball's death beneath the wheels of a car, and Koko's grief is dramatically recorded on film. Fortunately, Koko was given the opportunity to have another kitten, and chose a second tailless Manx. In a happy new beginning, she is shown cuddling "Lipstick." In beautiful color photos, and a brief accompanying text, Patterson and Cohn let readers see beneath the glossy fur, the heavy brows and the animal shape to the gentle mind that wanted something to love and be loved by. An empathy-building book of high degree. Patricia Manning, Eastchester Public Library, N.Y.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.In The Education of Koko, an adult title, Patterson described her successful career as a teacher and caretaker of a female gorilla, Koko. Since 1972, the author and Koko have been communicating in sign language, mostly on subjects important to the big, surprisingly gentle animal. Before Koko's 12th birthday, she signed that she wanted "Cereal there. Good there drink. Cat." Later she repeated, "Cat. Cat. Cat." So Patterson brought a kitten to visit; Koko named him All Ball (he had no tail) and mothered the mite with the love visible in Cohn's wonderful color photos. They show vividly the humanlike relationship developing between the huge gorilla and her tiny baby. When All Ball is killed by a car and Koko signs "Cry, sad, frown," and weeps, we know why the author cries too. It's gratifying to report that, in time, Koko expressed "Good. Nice." Her new kitten had come to stay. <br>Copyright 1985 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Plants vs. Zombies Volume 10: Rumble at Lake Gumbo</h2><p><b>Calling all Cat-Tail Commanders and Spudmarines--the battle for clean water begins!

She was inspired to write this story after spending time in Nigeria with the Peace Corps. Mary travels extensively to explore different cultures and discover new ways to see the world, and enjoys sharing that experience with children and adults through her books.<br><br>Carla Golembe is an award-winning illustrator, artist, author, and teacher. Her artwork, in a wide range of mediums including acrylic on paper and canvas, gouache, and monotype, has been featured at galleries across the country. <br>Kindergarten-Grade 3-- This pourquoi tale, first told 500 years ago by the Bini tribe of Nigeria, has a topical message that is accessible to children without being heavy-handed. ``In the beginning,'' the sky was so close to the earth that anyone who was hungry could just reach up, take a piece, and eat it. The sky was delicious, tasting sometimes of meat stew, sometimes of roasted corn. But the people grew careless with the sky's gifts, taking more than they needed to satisfy their hunger. The sky grew angry, threatening to withhold its gifts if the people continued to waste them. True to its promise, the sky moved far away, and the Bini were forced to plow the fields and hunt the forest. Golembe's striking illustrations deepen and enrich this simple tale, adding immensely to the book's appeal. Using a strong, sure line and a palette of deep, vibrant colors, she evokes a timeless African landscape, resonating both the mythic and contemporary themes. The symbolic qualities of the story are strengthened by a deceptively simple composition and the weight of the flat, stylized figures, done in dense, pure black. An eye-catching choice for folklore or picture book collections, and especially useful in supplementing multicultural and ecological curricula. --Linda Boyles, Alachua County Library District, Gainesville, FL<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Everything You Need for a Treehouse: (Children?s Treehouse Book, Story Book for Kids, Nature Book for Kids)</h2><p>"Delightful!" &#x2014;BookRiot<br><br>"One magical, impossible treehouse after another." &#x2014;The Wall Street Journal<br><br>Treehouses are for wonder. <br>Treehouses are for snacks.<br>Treehouses are for whispers and snickers and echoes. <br>Treehouses are for everyone.<br>This magical work of art from acclaimed picture book creators Carter Higgins and Emily Hughes celebrates the universal wonder of treehouses and all the adventure that live among branches.</p><p>Carter Higgins has worked as both a motion graphics designer and a librarian.

In 1939, he graduated from Northwest College in Seattle, Washington, and for the next decade served as pastor with several churches in the Northwest. In 1950, he was called to the pastorate of Central Assembly of God Christian Life Center in Boise, Idaho, where the average Sunday morning attendance grew to over 1800 at the time of his death in 1979. His story continues to bring assurance to thousands worldwide as they learn how God has placed angels with them to protect them from the fiery darts of the enemy.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>When Marian Sang: The True Recital of Marian Anderson</h2><p>Marian Anderson is best known for her historic concert at the Lincoln Memorial in 1939, which drew an integrated crowd of 75,000 people in pre-Civil Rights America. While this momentous event showcased the uniqueness of her voice, the strength of her character, and the struggles of the times in which she lived, it is only part of her story. Like the operatic arias Marian would come to sing, Ryan&#39;s text is as moving as a libretto, and Selznick&#39;s pictures as exquisitely detailed and elaborately designed as a stage set. What emerges most profoundly from their shared vision is a role model of courage.</p><p>As this skilled duo did with <i>Amelia and Eleanor Go for a Ride</i>, Pam Mu�oz Ryan and Brian Selznick bring to life the story of yet another remarkable American woman, gifted black contralto Marian Anderson.<p>Undoubtedly one of America's greatest singers, Anderson was hardly known in her own country because of her race--music schools ignored her applications ("We don't take colored!") and even after she began singing professionally, many venues only featured white performers. Ryan's well-paced story becomes especially poignant as she recounts Anderson's overwhelming success in Europe ("one newspaper in Sweden called it 'Marian Fever' ... In Austria, the world-famous conductor Arturo Toscanini announced that what he had heard, one was privileged to hear only once in a hundred years"). The book reaches its climax with a wordless, deep brown two-page spread from Selznick, a crowd's-eye view of Anderson singing at the Lincoln Memorial in 1939, an historic concert that drew an integrated audience of over 75,000.</p><p>Ryan's simple, metered text (punctuated frequently by lyrics) captures the quiet drama of Anderson's story, and kids will especially identify with the confusion and frustration of young Marian. And as with the pair's previous collaboration, Selznick's rich illustrations ably convey the undeniable strength and courage of a talented, determined woman.

Every morning I would tell myself, &#x201c;Today is going to be different,&#x201d; and every morning was a variation of the one before: &#x201c;You gave her more than me!&#x201d; . . . &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the pink cup. I want the blue cup.&#x201d; . . . &#x201c;This oatmeal looks like throw-up.&#x201d; . . . &#x201c;He punched me.&#x201d; . . . &#x201c;I never touched him!&#x201d; . . . &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t go to my room. You&#x2019;re not the boss over me!&#x201d;<br><br>They finally wore me down. And though it was the last thing I ever dreamed I&#x2019;d be doing, I joined a parent group. The group met at a local child-guidance center and was led by a young psychologist, Dr. Haim Ginott.<br><br>The meeting was intriguing. The subject was &#x201c;children&#x2019;s feelings,&#x201d; and the two hours sped by. I came home with a head spinning with new thoughts and a notebook full of undigested ideas:<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br><i>Direct connection between how kids feel and how they behave.</i> <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br><i>When kids feel right, they&#x2019;ll behave right.</i> <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br><i>How do we help them to feel right?</i> <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br><i>By accepting their feelings!</i> <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br><i>Problem&#x2014;Parents don&#x2019;t usually accept their children&#x2019;s feelings. For example:</i> <br><br><i>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t really feel that way.&#x201d;</i> <br><br><i>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re just saying that because you&#x2019;re tired.&#x201d;</i> <br><br><i>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no reason to be so upset.&#x201d;</i> <br><br><i>Steady denial of feelings can confuse and enrage kids. Also teaches them </i>not<i> to know what their feelings are&#x2014;not to trust them.</i><br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>After the session I remember thinking, &#x201c;Maybe other parents do that. I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; Then I started listening to myself. Here are some sample conversations from my home&#x2014;just from a single day.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>CHILD:Mommy, I&#x2019;m tired.ME:You couldn&#x2019;t be tired. You just napped.CHILD:(<i>louder</i>) But I&#x2019;m tired.ME:You&#x2019;re not tired. You&#x2019;re just a little sleepy. Let&#x2019;s get dressed.CHILD:(<i>wailing</i>) No, I&#x2019;m tired!CHILD:Mommy, it&#x2019;s hot in here.ME:It&#x2019;s cold. Keep your sweater on.CHILD:No, I&#x2019;m hot.ME:I said, &#x201c;Keep your sweater on!&#x201d;CHILD:No, I&#x2019;m hot.CHILD:That TV show was boring.ME:No, it wasn&#x2019;t. It was very interesting.CHILD:It was stupid.ME:It was educational.CHILD:It stunk.ME:Don&#x2019;t talk that way!<br>&nbsp;<br><br>Can you see what was happening? Not only were all our conversations turning into arguments, I was also telling my children over and over again not to trust their own perceptions but to rely on mine instead.<br><br>Once I was aware of what I was doing, I was determined to change. But I wasn&#x2019;t sure how to go about it. What finally helped me most was actually putting myself in my children&#x2019;s shoes. I asked myself, &#x201c;Suppose I were a child who was tired, or hot or bored? And suppose I wanted that all-important grown-up in my life to know what I was feeling . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>Over the next weeks I tried to tune in to what I thought my children might be experiencing, and when I did, my words seemed to follow naturally. I wasn&#x2019;t just using a technique. I really meant it when I said, &#x201c;So you&#x2019;re still feeling tired&#x2014;even though you just napped.&#x201d; Or &#x201c;I&#x2019;m cold, but for you it&#x2019;s hot in here.&#x201d; Or &#x201c;I can see you didn&#x2019;t care much for that show.&#x201d; After all, we were two separate people, capable of having two different sets of feelings. Neither of us was right or wrong. We each felt what we felt.<br><br>For a while, my new skill was a big help. There was a noticeable reduction in the number of arguments between the children and me. Then one day my daughter announced, &#x201c;I hate Grandma,&#x201d; and it was <i>my mother</i> she was talking about. I never hesitated for a second. &#x201c;That is a terrible thing to say,&#x201d; I snapped. &#x201c;You know you don&#x2019;t mean it. I don&#x2019;t ever want to hear that coming out of your mouth again.&#x201d;<br><br>That little exchange taught me something else about myself. I could be very accepting about most of the feelings the children had, but let one of them tell me something that made me angry or anxious and I&#x2019;d instantly revert to my old way.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve since learned that my reaction was not that unusual. On the following page you&#x2019;ll find examples of other statements children make that often lead to an automatic denial from their parents. Please read each statement and jot down what you think a parent might say if he were denying his child&#x2019;s feelings.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>I. CHILD: I don&#x2019;t like the new baby.<br><br>PARENT: (<i>denying the feeling</i>)<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>II. CHILD: I had a dumb birthday party. (After you went &#x201c;all out&#x201d; to make it a wonderful day.)<br><br>PARENT: (<i>denying the feeling</i>)<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>III. CHILD: I&#x2019;m not wearing this stupid retainer anymore. It hurts. I don&#x2019;t care what the orthodontist says!<br><br>PARENT: (<i>denying the feeling</i>)<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>IV. CHILD: I hate that new coach! Just because I was one minute late he kicked me off the team.<br><br>PARENT: (<i>denying the feeling</i>)<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Did you find yourself writing things like:<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not so. I know in your heart you really love the baby.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What are you talking about? You had a wonderful party&#x2014;ice cream, birthday cake, balloons. Well, that&#x2019;s the last party you&#x2019;ll ever have!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your retainer can&#x2019;t hurt that much. After all the money we&#x2019;ve invested in your mouth, you&#x2019;ll wear that thing whether you like it or not!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You have no right to be mad at the coach. It&#x2019;s your fault. You should have been on time.&#x201d;<br><br>Somehow this kind of talk comes easily to many of us. But how do children feel when they hear it? In order to get a sense of what it&#x2019;s like to have one&#x2019;s feelings dismissed, try the following exercise:<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Imagine that you&#x2019;re at work. Your employer asks you to do an extra job for him. He wants it ready by the end of the day. You mean to take care of it immediately, but because of a series of emergencies that come up you completely forget. Things are so hectic, you barely have time for your own lunch.<br><br>As you and a few coworkers are getting ready to go home, your boss comes over to you and asks for the finished piece of work. Quickly you try to explain how unusually busy you were today.<br><br>He interrupts you. In a loud, angry voice he shouts, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not interested in your excuses! What the hell do you think I&#x2019;m paying you for&#x2014;to sit around all day on your butt?&#x201d; As you open your mouth to speak, he says, &#x201c;Save it,&#x201d; and walks off to the elevator.<br><br>Your coworkers pretend not to have heard. You finish gathering your things and leave the office. On the way home you meet a friend. You&#x2019;re still so upset that you find yourself telling him or her what had just taken place.<br><br>Your friend tries to &#x201c;help&#x201d; you in eight different ways. As you read each response, tune in to your immediate &#x201c;gut&#x201d; reaction and then write it down. (There are no right or wrong reactions. Whatever you feel is right for you.)<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>I. <i>Denial of Feelings:</i> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no reason to be so upset. It&#x2019;s foolish to feel that way. You&#x2019;re probably just tired and blowing the whole thing out of proportion. It can&#x2019;t be as bad as you make it out to be. Come on, smile . . . You look so nice when you smile.&#x201d;<br><br>Your reaction:<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>II. <i>The Philosophical Response:</i> &#x201c;Look, life is like that. Things don&#x2019;t always turn out the way we want. You have to learn to take things in stride. In this world, nothing is perfect.&#x201d;<br><br>Your reaction:<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>III. <i>Advice:</i> &#x201c;You know what I think you should do? Tomorrow morning go straight to your boss&#x2019;s office and say, &#x2018;Look, I was wrong.&#x2019; Then sit right down and finish that piece of work you neglected today. Don&#x2019;t get trapped by those little emergencies that come up. And if you&#x2019;re smart and you want to keep that job of yours, you&#x2019;ll make sure nothing like that ever happens again.&#x201d;<br><br>Your reaction:<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>IV. <i>Questions:</i> &#x201c;What exactly were those emergencies you had that would cause you to forget a special request from your boss?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you realize he&#x2019;d be angry if you didn&#x2019;t get to it immediately?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Has this ever happened before?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you follow him when he left the room and try to explain again?&#x201d;<br><br>Your reaction:<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>V. <i>Defense of the Other Person:</i> &#x201c;I can understand your boss&#x2019;s reaction. He&#x2019;s probably under terrible pressure. You&#x2019;re lucky he doesn&#x2019;t lose his temper more often.&#x201d;<br><br>Your reaction:<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>VI. <i>Pity:</i> &#x201c;Oh, you poor thing. That is terrible! I feel so sorry for you, I could just cry.&#x201d;<br><br>Your reaction:<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>VII. <i>Amateur Psychoanalysis:</i> &#x201c;Has it ever occurred to you that the real reason you&#x2019;re so upset by this is because your employer represents a father figure in your life? As a child you probably worried about displeasing your father, and when your boss scolded you it brought back your early fears of rejection. Isn&#x2019;t that true?&#x201d;<br><br>Your reaction:<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>VIII. <i>An Empathic Response</i> (an attempt to tune into the feelings of another): &#x201c;Boy, that sounds like a rough experience. To be subjected to an attack like that in front of other people, especially after having been under so much pressure, must have been pretty hard to take!&#x201d;<br><br>Your reaction:<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>You&#x2019;ve just been exploring your own reactions to some fairly typical ways that people talk. Now I&#x2019;d like to share with you some of my personal reactions. When I&#x2019;m upset or hurting, the last thing I want to hear is advice, philosophy, psychology, or the other fellow&#x2019;s point of view. That kind of talk makes me only feel worse than before. Pity leaves me feeling pitiful; questions put me on the defensive; and most infuriating of all is to hear that I have no reason to feel what I&#x2019;m feeling. My overriding reaction to most of these responses is &#x201c;Oh, forget it. . . . What&#x2019;s the point of going on?&#x201d;<br><br>But let someone really listen, let someone acknowledge my inner pain and give me a chance to talk more about what&#x2019;s troubling me, and I begin to feel less upset, less confused, more able to cope with my feelings and my problem.<br><br>I might even say to myself, &#x201c;My boss is usually fair. . . . I suppose I should have taken care of that report immediately. . . . But I still can&#x2019;t overlook what he did. . . . Well, I&#x2019;ll go in early tomorrow and write that report first thing in the morning. . . . But when I bring it to his office I&#x2019;ll let him know how upsetting it was for me to be spoken to in that way. . . . And I&#x2019;ll also let him know that, from now on, if he has any criticism I would appreciate being told privately.&#x201d;<br><br>The process is no different for our children. They too can help themselves if they have a listening ear and an empathic response. But the language of empathy does not come naturally to us. It&#x2019;s not part of our &#x201c;mother tongue.&#x201d; Most of us grew up having our feelings denied. To become fluent in this new language of acceptance, we have to learn and practice its methods. Here are some ways to help children deal with their feelings.<br><br>TO HELP WITH FEELINGS<br><br>1. Listen with full attention.<br><br>2. Acknowledge their feelings with a word&#x2014;&#x201c;Oh&#x201d; . . . &#x201c;Mmm&#x201d; . . . &#x201c;I see.&#x201d;<br><br>3. Give their feelings a name.<br><br>4. Give them their wishes in fantasy.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the next few pages you&#x2019;ll see the contrast between these methods and the ways that people usually respond to a child who is in distress.<br><br>� 1980 Adele Faber</p><h2>A is for Alibi (Kinsey Millhone Alphabet Mysteries, No. 1)</h2><p><p><b>READ THE SENSATIONAL BLOCKBUSTER THAT STARTED IT ALL!</b></p><p><i>Take it from the top in #</i>1 New York Times<i> bestselling author Sue Grafton's knockout thriller that introduced detective Kinsey Millhone&#x2015;and a hot new attitude&#x2015;to crime fiction...</i></p><p><b>A IS FOR AVENGER</b><br>A tough-talking former cop, private investigator Kinsey Millhone has set up a modest detective agency in a quiet corner of Santa Teresa, California.

When his older sister, Jessie, shows off her new shimmery skirt, Casey wants to wear a shimmery skirt too. When Jessie comes home from a party with glittery nails, Casey wants glittery nails too. And when Abuelita visits wearing an armful of sparkly bracelets, Casey gets one to wear, just like Jessie. The adults in Casey&#39;s life embrace his interests, but Jessie isn&#39;t so sure. Boys aren&#39;t supposed to wear sparkly, shimmery, glittery things. Then, when older boys at the library tease Casey for wearing &#34;girl&#34; things, Jessie realizes that Casey has the right to be himself and wear whatever he wants. Why can&#39;t both she and Casey love all things shimmery, glittery, and sparkly? Here is a sweet, heartwarming story about acceptance, respect, and the freedom to be yourself in a world where any gender expression should be celebrated. Sparkly things are for everyone to enjoy!</p><p><p>LESLEA NEWMAN is the author of seventy books for readers of all ages. She has received<br> many literary accolades, including poetry fellowships from the National Endowment of the Arts and the Massachusetts Artists Foundation, and has served as Poet Laureate of Northampton, Massachusetts, from 2008 to 2010. In addition to creating her own books, Newman teaches writing for children and young adults at Spalding University's brief-residency MFA in Writing program. She wrote this book to celebrate all the "sparkle boys" she knows. Newman lives in Northampton, Massachusetts, with her spouse, Mary Vazquez.</p>PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;When older sister Jessie shows off her shimmery accessories, little brother Casey wants them, too, even if Jessie disapproves of sparkles on boys. In three repetitive vignettes featuring the siblings, Jessie appeals in turn to their mom, dad, and Abuelita to back up her claim that boys can't have what she has. In each case, the adult hesitates but ultimately affirms that Casey may wear a skirt, nail polish, and a bracelet if he likes. This delights Casey while making his sister increasingly grumpy. In the fourth and final tale, other children at the library misgender Casey and say that "everyone will laugh at" his clothes. Of course, in the grand tradition of older siblings everywhere, Jessie decides that no one else is permitted to tease or judge her younger brother, and she paints Casey's nails herself when they return home. Mola's winsome pencil and digital illustrations have a style that combines John Parra and Mary Blair. Though somewhat on the wordy side, this slice-of-life story will appeal to families, whether or not they include gender-creative members.

But little has been written or researched about the potential to heal these attachment wounds and address the damage sustained from neglect or poor parenting in early childhood. This book presents a therapy that focuses on precisely these areas. Laurel Parnell, leader and innovator in the field of eye-movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), offers us a way to embrace two often separate worlds of knowing: the science of early attachment relationships and the practice of healing within an EMDR framework. This beautifully written and clinically practical book combines attachment theory, one of the most dynamic theoretical areas in psychotherapy today, with EMDR to teach therapists a new way of healing clients with relational trauma and attachment deficits.<br><br> Readers will find science-based ideas about how our early relationships shape the way the mind and brain develop from our young years into our adult lives. Our connections with caregivers induce neural circuit firings that persist throughout our lives, shaping how we think, feel, remember, and behave. When we are lucky enough to have secure attachment experiences in which we feel seen, safe, soothed, and secure&#x2015;the &#x201c;four S&#x2019;s of attachment&#x201d; that serve as the foundation for a healthy mind&#x2015;these relational experiences stimulate the neuronal activation and growth of the integrative fibers of the brain.<br> EMDR is a powerful tool for catalyzing integration in an individual across several domains, including memory, narrative, state, and vertical and bilateral integration. In Laurel Parnell&#x2019;s attachment-based modifications of the EMDR approach, the structural foundations of this integrative framework are adapted to further catalyze integration for individuals who have experienced non-secure attachment and developmental trauma.<br><br> The book is divided into four parts. Part I lays the groundwork and outlines the five basic principles that guide and define the work. Part II provides information about attachment-repair resources available to clinicians. This section can be used by therapists who are not trained in EMDR. Part III teaches therapists how to use EMDR specifically with an attachment-repair orientation, including client preparation, target development, modifications of the standard EMDR protocol, desensitization, and using interweaves. Case material is used throughout. Part IV includes the presentation of three cases from different EMDR therapists who used attachment-focused EMDR with their clients. These cases illustrate what was discussed in the previous chapters and allow the reader to observe the theoretical concepts put into clinical practice&#x2015;giving the history and background of the clients, actual EMDR sessions, attachment-repair interventions within these sessions and the rationale for them, and information about the effects of the<br> interventions and the course of treatment.</p><p>Laurel Parnell, Ph.D., PhD, is one of the world&#x2019;s leading experts on EMDR. She is the author of two previous books on&nbsp;EMDR,&nbsp;EMDR in the Treatment of Adults Abused as Children and Transforming Trauma:&nbsp;EMDR&nbsp;as well as articles and a book chapter. A clinical psychologist, she has trained thousands in EMDR through her international workshops. She is author of several books on EMDR and lives in San Rafael, California.&#x201c;Parnell&#x2019;s book is well organized, easy to read, and gives clear examples of what the therapeutic process looks like when using AF-EMDR. . . . This highly accessible book is a welcome addition to the EMDR library and will enrich and inform the skills of mental health professionals who work with relational traumas.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Milton H. Erickson Foundation Newsletter</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[T]his book is exceptionally well written . . . . Parnell has taken the original model and made it significantly more accessible within the framework of attachment repair and healing trauma. . . . I will be reading her book again and sharing it with my colleagues.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>PsychCentral</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This book has a clear writing style, a balanced blend of neuroscience and clinical artistry, and an unwavering focus on various types of resources to help even severely traumatized clients repair internal wounds and develop new skills for healthy interpersonal relationships. Clinical examples from Parnell&#x2019;s own work, as well as extended cases provided by professionals she has trained and supervised, make the sound principles she espouses come alive. Ranging from a clear blueprint to prepare clients for intensive developmental reworking to advanced topics such as resource interweave sequencing, identifying and working with ego states that block processing, and the use of animals to repair disruption in early maternal attachment, <em>Attachment-Focused EMDR</em> contains something for every reader at every level of experience. Anyone who treats trauma will benefit from this well-crafted work. I cannot recommend this book highly enough!&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Maggie Phillips, author of <em>Healing the Divided Self</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Realizing the critical importance of both client-therapist attunement and body sensory input, Laurel Parnell blends both to create a unique therapeutic container. Supported by many informative case study dialogues, this book provides a valuable template for the ideal therapeutic interactive process. This groundbreaking book is certain to set a new standard for trauma therapy.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Robert Scaer, MD, author of <em>The Trauma Spectrum</em> and <em>8 Keys to Brain-Body Balance</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Master clinician Laurel Parnell has written a book that does justice to the depth and effectiveness of her clinical work. <em>Attachment-Focused EMDR</em> reveals how healing deepens when the power of the EMDR method is brought to bear both upon clients&#x2019; relational traumas and upon the healing residing in the genuine connection between client and therapist. Readers will benefit from Parnell&#x2019;s wisdom, clinical experience, and direct and down-to-earth writing style, as well as the case examples she provides with transcripts from actual sessions. I highly recommend this book&#x2015;with its relational focus, it will enrich and deepen the practice of any clinician interested in working more effectively.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Diana Fosha, PhD, Developer of AEDP, co-editor of <em>The Healing Power of Emotion</em></strong></p><h2>My Pocket Mantras: Powerful Words to Connect, Comfort, and Protect</h2><p>Find a moment of peace and comfort with this beautiful, pocket-sized mantra book&#x2014;giving you a chance to easily recite mantras throughout the day or whenever you need a pick-me-up.<br><br>Words are powerful and have the ability to shape our thoughts, change our perception, connect with others, and provide comfort in our daily lives. <i>My Pocket Mantras</i> provides more than 140 mantras designed to help you shift your mindset in a positive way.

THE EARSPLITTING MUSIC, THE gyrating bodies, the inebriated smiles&#x2014;not my thing. My ideal Saturday night would be at home, snuggling on the sofa and watching a rom-com with my boyfriend, Patch. Predictable, low-key&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. normal. My name is Nora Grey, and while I used to be an average American teen, buying my clothes at the J. Crew outlet and spending my babysitting money on iTunes, normal and I have recently become perfect strangers. As in, I wouldn&#x2019;t know normal if it marched up and poked me in the eye.<br> <br>Normal and I parted ways when Patch strolled into my life. Patch has seven inches on me, operates on cold, hard logic, moves like smoke, and lives alone in a supersecret, superswanky studio beneath Delphic Amusement Park. The sound of his voice, low and sexy, can melt my heart in three seconds flat. He&#x2019;s also a fallen angel, kicked out of heaven for his flexibility when it comes to following rules. I personally believe Patch scared the pants off normal, and it took off running for the far side of the world.<br> <br>I might not have normalcy, but I do have stability. Namely, in the form of my best friend of twelve years, Vee Sky. Vee and I have an unshakable bond that even a laundry list of differences can&#x2019;t break. They say opposites attract, and Vee and I are proof of the validity of the statement. I am slender and tallish&#x2014;by human standards&#x2014;with big curly hair that tests my patience, and I&#x2019;m a type A personality. Vee is even taller, with ash-blond hair, serpentine-green eyes, and more curves than a roller coaster track. Almost always, Vee&#x2019;s wishes trump mine. And unlike me, Vee lives for a good party.<br> <br>Tonight Vee&#x2019;s wish to seek out a good time took us across town to a four-story brick warehouse throbbing with club music, swimming with fake IDs, and jam-packed with bodies producing enough sweat to take greenhouse gases to a whole new level. The layout inside was standard: a dance floor sandwiched between a stage and a bar. Rumor had it that a secret door behind the bar led to the basement, and the basement led to a man named Storky, who operated a thriving pirated anything business. Community religious leaders kept threatening to board up Coldwater&#x2019;s hotbed of iniquity for disorderly teens&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. also known as the Devil&#x2019;s Handbag.<br> <br>&#x201c;Groove it, baby,&#x201d; Vee yelled at me over the mindless thump, thump, thump of music, lacing her fingers through mine and swaying our hands over our heads. We were at the center of the dance floor, being jostled and bumped on every side. &#x201c;This is how Saturday night&#x2019;s supposed to be. You and me gettin&#x2019; down, letting loose, working up good ol&#x2019;-fashioned girl-sweat.&#x201d;<br> <br>I did my best to give an enthusiastic nod, but the guy behind me kept stepping on the heel of my ballet flat, and at five-second intervals, I had to shove my foot back into it. The girl to my right was dancing with her elbows out, and if I wasn&#x2019;t careful, I knew I&#x2019;d get clipped.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe we should get drinks,&#x201d; I called to Vee. &#x201c;Feels like Florida in here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s &#x2019;cause you and me are burning up the place. Check out the guy at the bar. He can&#x2019;t take his eyes off your smokin&#x2019; moves.&#x201d; She licked her finger and pressed it to my bare shoulder, making a sizzling noise.<br> <br>I followed her gaze&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and my heart lurched.<br> <br>Dante Matterazzi lifted his chin in acknowledgment. His next gesture was a little more subtle.<br> <br>Wouldn&#x2019;t have pegged you for a dancer, he spoke to my mind.<br> <br>Funny, I would have pegged you for a stalker, I shot back.<br> <br>Dante Matterazzi and I both belonged to the Nephilim race, hence the innate ability to mind-speak, but the similarities stopped there. Dante didn&#x2019;t know how to give it a rest, and I didn&#x2019;t know how much longer I could dodge him. I&#x2019;d met him for the first time just this morning, when he&#x2019;d come to my house to announce that fallen angels and Nephilim were on the brink of war and I was in charge of leading the latter, but now I needed a break from war talk. It was overwhelming. Or maybe I was in denial. Either way, I wished he&#x2019;d disappear.<br> <br>Left a message on your cell phone, he said.<br> <br>Gee, I must have missed it. More like I deleted it.<br> <br>We need to talk.<br> <br>Kind of busy. To emphasize my point, I rolled my hips and swung my arms side to side, doing my best to imitate Vee, whose favorite television network was BET, and it showed. She had hiphop stamped on her soul.<br> <br>A faint smile quirked Dante&#x2019;s mouth. While you&#x2019;re at it, get your friend to give you some pointers. You&#x2019;re floundering. Meet me out back in two.<br> <br>I glared at him. Busy, remember?<br> <br>This can&#x2019;t wait. With a meaningful arch of his eyebrows, he disappeared into the crowd.<br> <br>&#x201c;His loss,&#x201d; Vee said. &#x201c;He can&#x2019;t handle the heat, that&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;About those drinks,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Can I bring you a Coke?&#x201d; Vee didn&#x2019;t look ready to give up dancing anytime soon, and as much as I wanted to avoid Dante, I figured it was best to just get this over with. Suck it up and talk to him. The alternative was having him shadow me all night.<br> <br>&#x201c;Coke with lime,&#x201d; Vee said.<br> <br>I edged my way off the dance floor and, after making sure Vee wasn&#x2019;t watching, ducked down a side hallway and out the back door. The alley was bathed in blue moonlight. A red Porsche Panamera was parked in front of me, and Dante leaned against it, arms folded loosely over his chest.<br> <br>Dante is six feet nine with the physique of a soldier fresh out of boot camp. Case in point: He has more muscle tone in his neck than I have in my entire body. Tonight he was wearing baggy khakis and a white linen shirt unbuttoned halfway down his chest, revealing a deep V of smooth, hairless skin.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice car,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;It gets the job done.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So does my Volkswagen, and it cost considerably less.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Takes more than four wheels to be a car.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ugh.<br> <br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; I said, tapping my foot. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s so urgent?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You still dating that fallen angel?&#x201d;<br> <br>It was only the third time in as many hours that he&#x2019;d asked. Twice by text messaging, and now face-to-face. My relationship with Patch had gone through a lot of ups and downs, but the current trend was upward. We weren&#x2019;t without our issues, however. In a world where Nephilim and fallen angels would rather die than smile at each other, dating a fallen angel was a definite no-no.<br> <br>I stood a little taller. &#x201c;You know it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Being careful?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Discreet is the watchword.&#x201d; Patch and I didn&#x2019;t need Dante to tell us it was wise not to make a lot of public appearances together. Nephilim and fallen angels never needed an excuse to teach each other a lesson, and racial tensions between the two groups were getting hotter with each passing day. It was autumn, October to be exact, and the Jewish month of Cheshvan was just days away.<br> <br>Every year during Cheshvan, fallen angels possess Nephilim bodies by the droves. Fallen angels have free rein to do as they please, and since it&#x2019;s the only time during the year they can actually feel physical sensation, their creativity knows no bounds. They chase after pleasure, pain, and everything in between, playing parasites to their Nephilim hosts. For Nephilim, Cheshvan is a hellish prison.<br> <br>If Patch and I were so much as seen holding hands by the wrong individuals, we&#x2019;d pay, one way or another.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s talk about your image,&#x201d; Dante said. &#x201c;We need to generate some positive media around your name. Boost Nephilim confidence in you.&#x201d;<br> <br>I gave a theatrical snap of my fingers. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you just hate it when your approval ratings are low?&#x201d;<br> <br>Dante frowned. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t a joke, Nora. Cheshvan starts in just over seventy-two hours, and that means war. Fallen angels on one side, us on the other. Everything rides on your shoulders&#x2014;you&#x2019;re the new leader of the Nephilim army. The blood oath you swore to Hank is in effect, and I don&#x2019;t think I have to remind you that the consequences of breaking it are very, very real.&#x201d;<br> <br>Queasiness pinched my stomach. I hadn&#x2019;t exactly applied for the job. Thanks to my deceased biological father, a truly twisted man named Hank Millar, I&#x2019;d been forced to inherit the position. With the help of an otherworldly blood transfusion, he&#x2019;d coerced me into transforming myself from mere human into purebred Nephil so I could take over his army. I&#x2019;d sworn an oath to lead his army, it had gone into effect upon his death, and if I failed to do that, my mom and I would die. Terms of the oath. No pressure.<br> <br>&#x201c;Despite every cautious measure I intend to implement, we can&#x2019;t completely erase your past. The Nephilim are digging around. There are rumors you&#x2019;re dating a fallen angel, and that your loyalties are split.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am dating a fallen angel.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dante rolled his eyes. &#x201c;Could you say it any louder?&#x201d;<br> <br>I shrugged. If that&#x2019;s what you really want. Then I opened my mouth, but Dante was beside me in an instant, covering it with his hand. &#x201c;I know it kills you, but could you make my job easy just this once?&#x201d; he murmured in my ear, glancing around at the shadows with obvious uneasiness, even though I was positive we were alone. I&#x2019;d only been a purebred Nephil for twenty-four hours, but I trusted my new, sharper sixth sense. If there were eavesdroppers lurking, I&#x2019;d know.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look, I know when we first met this morning I carelessly said the Nephilim would just have to deal with me dating a fallen angel,&#x201d; I said when he lowered his hand, &#x201c;but I wasn&#x2019;t thinking. I was angry. I&#x2019;ve spent the day giving this a lot of thought. I&#x2019;ve talked to Patch. We&#x2019;re being careful, Dante. Really careful.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice to know. But I still need you to do something for me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Like what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Date a Nephil. Date Scott Parnell.&#x201d;<br> <br>Scott was the first Nephil I&#x2019;d ever befriended, at the tender age of five. I hadn&#x2019;t known about his true heritage back then, but in recent months he&#x2019;d taken on the roles of first my tormentor, then my partner in crime, and eventually my friend. There were no secrets between us. Likewise, there was no romantic chemistry.<br> <br>I laughed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re killing me, Dante.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It would be for show. For the sake of appearances,&#x201d; he explained. &#x201c;Just until our race warms to you. You&#x2019;ve only been a Nephil one day. Nobody knows you. People need a reason to like you. We have to make them feel comfortable trusting you. Dating a Nephil is a good step in the right direction.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t date Scott,&#x201d; I told Dante. &#x201c;Vee likes him.&#x201d;<br> <br>To say Vee had been unlucky in love was putting it optimistically. In the past six months she&#x2019;d fallen for a narcissistic predator and a backstabbing slimeball. Not surprisingly, both relationships made her seriously doubt her instincts in love. Lately, she had unequivocally refused to so much as smile at the opposite sex&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. until Scott came along. Early last night, just hours before my biological father had compelled me to transform myself into a purebred Nephil, Vee and I had come to the Devil&#x2019;s Handbag to watch Scott play bass for his new band, Serpentine, and she hadn&#x2019;t stopped talking about him since. To sweep in and steal Scott now, even if it was a ruse, would be the ultimate low blow.<br> <br>&#x201c;It wouldn&#x2019;t be real,&#x201d; Dante repeated, as if that made everything just peachy.<br> <br>&#x201c;Would Vee know that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not exactly. You and Scott would have to be convincing together. A leak would be disastrous, so I&#x2019;d want to limit the truth to the two of us.&#x201d;<br> <br>Meaning Scott would also be a casualty of the ruse. I did the hands-on-hips thing, going for firm and immovable. &#x201c;Then you&#x2019;re going to have to come up with someone else.&#x201d; I wasn&#x2019;t enamored with the idea of fake-dating a Nephil to boost my popularity. In fact, it seemed like a disaster in the making, but I wanted this mess behind me. If Dante thought a Nephilim boyfriend would give me more street cred, so be it. It wouldn&#x2019;t be real. Obviously Patch wouldn&#x2019;t be thrilled, but tackle one problem at a time, right?<br> <br>Dante&#x2019;s mouth compressed into a line, and he shut his eyes briefly. Summoning patience. It was an expression I&#x2019;d grown quite accustomed to over the course of the day.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;d need to be revered in the Nephilim community,&#x201d; Dante said thoughtfully at last. &#x201c;Someone Nephilim would admire and approve of.&#x201d;<br> <br>I made an impatient gesture. &#x201c;Fine. Just throw someone other than Scott at me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Me.&#x201d;<br> <br>I flinched. &#x201c;Sorry. What? You?&#x201d; I was too stunned to burst into laughter.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; Dante asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you really want me to start listing reasons? Because I&#x2019;ll keep you here all night. You&#x2019;ve got to be at least five years older than me in human years&#x2014;total scandal fodder&#x2014;you don&#x2019;t have a sense of humor, and&#x2014;oh yeah. We can&#x2019;t stand each other.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a natural connection. I&#x2019;m your first lieutenant&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because Hank gave you the position. I had no say in that.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dante didn&#x2019;t seem to hear me, charging ahead with his make-believe version of events. &#x201c;We met and felt an instant and mutual attraction. I comforted you after your father&#x2019;s death. It&#x2019;s a believable story.&#x201d; He smiled. &#x201c;Lots of good publicity.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If you say the P word one more time, I&#x2019;m going to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. do something drastic.&#x201d; Like smack him. And then smack myself for even considering this plan.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sleep on it,&#x201d; Dante said. &#x201c;Mull it over.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mulling it over.&#x201d; I counted to three on my fingers. &#x201c;Okay, done. Bad idea. Really bad idea. My answer is no.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You have a better idea?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, but I&#x2019;ll need time to think it up.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure. No problem, Nora.&#x201d; He counted to three on his fingers. &#x201c;Okay, time&#x2019;s up. I needed a name first thing this morning. In case it isn&#x2019;t painfully obvious, your image is headed down the tubes. Word of your father&#x2019;s death, and subsequently your new leadership position, is spreading like wildfire. People are talking, and the talk isn&#x2019;t good. We need the Nephilim to believe in you. We need them to trust that you have their best interests in mind, and that you can finish your father&#x2019;s work and bring us out of bondage from fallen angels. We need them to rally behind you, and we&#x2019;re going to give them one good reason after another. Starting with a respected Nephilim boyfriend.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, babe, everything okay back here?&#x201d;<br> <br>Dante and I swung around. Vee stood in the doorway, eyeing us with equal parts wariness and curiosity.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey! Everything&#x2019;s fine,&#x201d; I said a little too enthusiastically.<br> <br>&#x201c;You never came back with our drinks, and I started to worry,&#x201d; Vee said. Her gaze shifted from me to Dante. Recognition sparked in her eyes, and I knew she remembered him from the bar. &#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; she asked him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Him?&#x201d; I cut in. &#x201c;Oh. Uh. Well, he&#x2019;s just some random guy&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Dante stepped forward, hand extended. &#x201c;Dante Matterazzi. I&#x2019;m a new friend of Nora&#x2019;s. We met earlier today when our mutual acquaintance, Scott Parnell, introduced us.&#x201d;<br> <br>Just like that, Vee&#x2019;s face lit up. &#x201c;You know Scott?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good friend of mine, actually.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Any friend of Scott&#x2019;s is a friend of mine.&#x201d;<br> <br>Inwardly, I gouged my eyes out.<br> <br>&#x201c;So what are you two doing back here?&#x201d; Vee asked us.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dante just picked out a new car,&#x201d; I said, stepping aside to give her an unobstructed view of the Porsche. &#x201c;He couldn&#x2019;t resist showing it off. Don&#x2019;t look too closely, though. I think the VIN number is missing. Poor Dante had to resort to theft, since he used up all his money getting his chest waxed, and boy, does it gleam.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Funny,&#x201d; Dante said. I thought maybe he&#x2019;d self-consciously fasten at least one more shirt button, but he didn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>&#x201c;If I had a car like that, I&#x2019;d show it off too,&#x201d; Vee said.<br> <br>Dante said, &#x201c;I tri...</p><h2>Moving Mountains Study Guide: Praying with Passion, Confidence, and Authority</h2><p><p>In Luke 11:1, the disciples asked Jesus, "Teach us to pray!" Most of us want to know more about how prayer works. While we are used to offering up prayers, we wonder if we are praying in the most effective way or if we are approaching the throne of God in the "right" way. We ask ourselves:</p><ul><li>How do I listen for God?</li><li>How do I pray for healing?</li><li>How do I pray when I am under spiritual attack?</li><li>How do I pray to break through strongholds of habitual sin?</li><li>How do I pray for protection?</li><li>How do I pray for my lost friends and family?</li></ul><p>In this eight-session video Bible study (DVD/digital video sold separately),&nbsp;bestselling author John Eldredge shows how we labor under the misconception that prayer is asking God to intervene instead of partnering with him to get things done. This faulty assumption leads to untold confusion and grief when we ask of God but can't sense He hears us&#x2014;or even cares. Rather, Jesus says, "I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven" (Matthew 16:19). When we operate from this position, we approach prayer with far greater confidence. We understand we have a role in making change happen and are not victims of circumstance&#x2014;that we are sons and daughters of God bestowed with tremendous authority.</p><p>Sessions include:</p><ol><li>There Is a Way Things Work</li><li>The Cry of the Heart</li><li>The Prayer of Intervention</li><li>The Prayer of Consecration</li><li>Listening Prayer</li><li>Warfare Prayer</li><li>Healing Prayer</li><li>Holding the Heart in Unanswered Prayer</li></ol><p>Designed for use with the&nbsp;<em>Moving Mountains Video Study&nbsp;</em>(sold separately).</p></p><p><p>John Eldredge is a bestselling author, a counselor, and a teacher.

In the letter Einstein perfectly captures what Rabbi Levy has come to believe about the human condition: that we are intimately connected and that we are blind to this truth. Wondering what had elicited such spiritual wisdom from a man of science, Levy leads us on a breathtaking journey full of wisdom, empathy, and humor, all the while helping us to reclaim our souls and glimpse the oneness that has been eluding us, live up to our gifts, and understand why we are here.</p></p><p>NAOMI LEVY is the author of the national bestseller <i>To Begin Again,</i> as well as <i>Talking to God</i> and <i>Hope Will Find You</i>. She is the founder and leader of NASHUVA, a groundbreaking Jewish spiritual outreach movement based in L.A.

It is difficult to overestimate her contribution. <i>Einstein and the Rabbi</i> is worthy of the matriarchs from whom originated the blessing of Jewish womanhood and who continue, through such as her, to bless it still." &#x2015;<b>Marianne Williamson, author of <i>A Return to Love </i>and <i>Everyday Grace</i></b><br><i><b></b></i><br>&#x201c;[Levy] is a gifted storyteller&#x2015;courageous, daring, witty and wise....

Kimmel, having loved traditional stories since he was a child, has written, retold, and adapted folktales and legends from around the world. Along with <i>Anansi and the Talking Melon</i>, Kimmel has written four other Anansi titles, including <i>Anansi&#x2019;s Party Time</i>, which was awarded Bank Street College&#x2019;s Best Children&#x2019;s Book of the Year in 2008. Dr. Kimmel lives in Portland, Oregon with his wife Doris.<br> &nbsp;<br> Janet Stevens has written and illustrated popular books for over 30 years.

Her books include New York Times Bestsellers, Time Magazine Best Books of the Year, ALA Notable books, and a Caldecott Honor. She is most proud of her numerous state book awards that were voted on by young readers. She has two children and lives in Boulder, Colorado.Grade 1-4 Anansi the Spider happens upon an unusual stone that magically puts him to sleep for an hour. The master trickster decides to use the rock to get the food stores from the rest of the local residents. Each animal is taken in turn to the strange moss-covered rock, says the magic phrase, and promptly falls asleep to have its food pilfered by Anansi. All the while, however, Little Bush Deer silently watches. Ultimately, it is small and shy Deer who outwits Anansi and returns the food to its rightful owners. Although no specific source is given, Kimmel has retold a West African tale (said to be known in Caribbean culture). The text is rhythmic, nicely building suspense to the inevitable conclusion. Stevens' complementary, colorful illustrations add detail, humor, and movement to the text. Here, Anansi is portrayed as a large eight-legged arachnid; his expression is in his motion. The other animals are almost realistic, although with facial expressions that are characteristic of the artist's work. This new picture book Anansi tale will be welcomed by all trickster fans.

He identified twelve inorganic tissue-salts that are essential for the healthy functioning of the human body. He showed that when there is a deficiency of any of these salts in the body tissues, certain typical symptoms arise. You can use these symptoms to identify the specific deficiency. Then all you have to do is supplement the deficient tissue-salt in a dynamic (potency 6X) form. It will stimulate the vital force of the body, which will in turn carry out the healing. Here is an up-to-date, clear, and concise book that you can use to heal yourself, your family and friends. It tells you how the common everyday ailments arise in the body and how to use the tissue salts to heal them. The book is simple to understand and easy to use; and the results are amazing. A striking contrast to this modern approach to healing (the allopathic medical system) is found in the classical system of Biochemic Remedies. When you treat a disorder with these tissue salts, you don&#x2019;t suppress the symptoms. Hence, the acute symptoms don&#x2019;t get converted into chronic disorders. You merely USE THE SYMPTOMS TO DIAGNOSE the appropriate biochemic remedy that necessary in each case. The remedy will stimulate the body&#x2019;s vital force and make it more responsive. The vital force will then eliminate the toxins from the body tissues and begin to restore the natural functions of the body. In this way natural health is restored. The biochemic system is &#x2018;HOLISTIC&#x2019; since it relies on restoring the body&#x2019;s vital force. The vital force is an &#x2018;overall principle&#x2019;, which is not confined to any part of the body. And this force is restored by administering the appropriate tissue salt as a vibration (potency) that is taken up in sugar of milk. Thus the healing happens through a natural process. NOTE: The Biochemical system considers the vital force as a power in our &#x2018;energy body&#x2019;. This power animates our physical body and keeps it working as a whole. It is only when the vital force has become insufficient that the individual body parts of the body become susceptible to disorders and infections. This Biochemic system is simple to understand and easy to use. And further, it comes without the &#x2018;side-effects&#x2019; that normally arise from using the drug therapy. Still further, you have to select a remedy from just 12 tissue salts. And to make the selection you don&#x2019;t need to know the nature of a disease in detail or depend on expensive laboratory test and investigation. My mother used to treat us (family) with these biochemic remedies when we were kids. And she did a pretty good job with it even though she had no training in healthcare! To be able to treat the patient or yourself effectively, you have to only study the &#x2018;guiding symptoms&#x2019; indicated for each of the 12 Biochemic remedies. I have personally used these Biochemic remedies, and over the years I have found the results to be consistent and very satisfactory. This book is written from experience. Great care is taken to characterise the signature of each tissue-salt. You have to only read the short description of the tissue-salts to diagnose the remedy. You don&#x2019;t have to search through a large number of symptoms and remedies as in Homeopathy. With a little practice in this art you can become a domestic physician (not a licensed physician). Then you can safely help yourself, your family and your friends in health matters. It will overcome your helplessness on health issues and reduce your unnecessary dependence on the medical profession. The new second edition of the book has many improvements: The chapter &#x2018;Tips for Differentiating the Remedies&#x2019; is added; and the chapter on &#x2018;Remedies for Classified Diseases&#x2019; is revised. These improvements will make it much easier for you to diagnose the correct Biochemic remedy and to use it more effectively in each case.</p><p>He was educated in Chemistry at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (BS), and University of California, (MS &amp; PhC).

Where do they go?</i></p><p>A little girl follows tracks outside her window after a fresh snowfall, only to realize that the tracks in the snow are her own from the day before&#x2015;and that they lead her home. This diminutive and sweet picture book is as cozy as a cup of hot chocolate.</p><p>Like Ezra Jack Keats' <i>The Snowy Day</i>, this lovely celebration of snow and winter is just right for the littlest readers.</p></p><p><p><b>Wong Herbert Yee</b> is the author and illustrator of <i>Who Likes Rain?</i>, <i>Fireman Small</i> and <i>Big Black Bear</i>, among other books. Born in Detroit, Michigan, one of his favorite memories of childhood is of leaving the first tracks on fresh-fallen snow. He also remembers his first grade teacher tacking one of his drawings on the bulletin board&#x2015;ever since then, he's been an artist. He studied printmaking at Wayne State University. He lives with his wife and daughter in Troy, Michigan.</p>PreS. "Just outside my window, / There are tracks in the snow. / Who made the tracks? / Where do they go?" Keen to find out, a little girl follows the tracks throughout her rural neighborhood. Yee cleverly lets the white of the paper stand in for snow, rendering the other elements in soft colored pencils and an almost pointillistic style: ice-blue footprints; woodland flora and fauna in muted browns and grays; and the little girl herself, whose bright-red hooded coat (reminiscent of Peter's in <i>The</i> Snowy Day) adds cheer to the otherwise muted scenes. The singsong text, however, isn't quite as effective; certain lines ("Is that a hippopotamus?") serve the demands of the rhyme scheme more than they advance the story. Even so, this unassuming book will be enjoyed for its petite trim size, its wintry charm, and the gently humorous solution to its small mystery: the girl finally realizes that the tracks were made yesterday by someone she knows very well--herself. <i>Jennifer Mattson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

A thorough knowledge of the opponent&#x2019;s strength, his probable line of attack, and his tactics are vital to achieving victory. So how complete and accurate is your understanding of your enemy, the devil? Did you even know you had an enemy?<br><br>The Bible clearly shows that every one of us lives in the midst of a spiritual battle, whether or not we realize it. Yet many&#x2014;even many believers&#x2014;make the mistake of dismissing the enemy as a benign cartoon character with horns and a tail. Others become preoccupied with the enemy, fearfully focusing on his power rather than living in the reality of God&#x2019;s strength. As you&#x2019;ll discover in the weeks ahead, neither approach reflects the battle-ready perspective we need to walk daily in victory.<br><br>It is imperative that we have accurate information about our enemy, who is bent on destroying our ability to effectively serve God.

The initial paratrooper assault is shown, as well as the storming of the five D-Day beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword. But the story does not end there. Once the Allies got ashore, they had to stay ashore. The Germans made every effort to push them back into the sea. This book depicts the such key events in the Allied liberation of Europe as:&nbsp;1. Construction of the Mulberry Harbors, two giant artificial harbors built in England and floated across the English Channel so that troops, vehicles, and supplies could be offloaded across the invasion beaches.2. The Capture of Cherbourg, the nearest French port, against a labyrinth of Gennan pillboxes.3. The American fight through the heavy bocage (hedgerow country) to take the vital town of Saint-L�.4. The British-Canadian struggle for the city of Caen against the &#x201c;Hitler Youth Division,&#x201d; made up of 23,000 seventeen- and eighteen-year-old Nazi fanatics.5. The breakout of General Patton&#x2019;s Third Army and the desperate US 30th Division&#x2019;s defense of Mortaine.6. The Falaise Pocket, known as the &#x201c;Killing Ground, &#x201d; where the remnants of two German armies were trapped and bombed and shelled into submission. The slaughter was so great that 5,000 Germans were buried in one mass grave. 7. The Liberation of Paris, led by the 2nd Free French Armored Division, which had been fighting for four long years with this goal in mind.<p></p></p><p><p><b></b></p> <p></p> <p>The thing that most people notice first about the region is the quiet, pastoral setting.

The tall cornfields in the shadow of the l'abbaye d'ardenne near Caen. It is a region that both time and history seems to have passed by.

Ragtime arrived on the upswing of Tin Pan Alley, when the popularity of pianos in&nbsp;the home was reaching its peak and an endless stream of sheet music flowed out to meet the demand. In the early 1900s, no name was more prominent on those sheet-music covers and no one wrote ragtime music more brilliantly than Scott Joplin.<br>This wonderful book brings together in one superbly produced playing edition all thirty-eight of Scott Joplin's piano rags, including his six collaborations, plus Joplin's own primer on how to play ragtime, the "School of Ragtime." Each rag has been reprinted, along with its sheet-music cover, from the original publisher's edition.<br>At the Williams' Brothers saloon in Sedalia, Missouri, Scott Joplin was known as "The Entertainer," and in 1897, in the upstairs room called the Maple Leaf Club, he wrote the rag that would one day be the first to sell over a million copies in sheet-music form. In time the "Maple Leaf Rag" also became the most recorded composition on piano roll, with forty known versions.<br>Most of Joplin's other rags were hits as well. Many bear the playful names that were given most rags, names like "The Strenuous Life," "Heliotrope Bouquet," and his last published piece, the "Silver Swan Rag." One of them, "The Entertainer," triggered a major revival of interest in his work when it was incorporated into the score of the popular film <i>The Sting.</i> All of them are here, each bearing the mark of Joplin's supreme originality.

Spontaneous healing is not a miracle but a fact of biology--the result of the natural healing system that each one of us is born with. Drawing on fascinating case histories as well as medical techniques from around the world, Dr. Andrew Weil shows how spontaneous healing has worked to resolve life-threatening diseases, severe trauma, and chronic pain. Weil then outlines an eight-week program in which you'll discover:<br><br>- The truth about spontaneous healing and how it interacts with the mind<br>- The foods, vitamins, supplements, and tonic herbs that will help you enhance your innate healing powers<br>- Advice on how to avoid environmental toxins and reduce stress<br>- The strengths and weaknesses of conventional and alternative treatments<br>- Natural methods to ameliorate common kinds of illnesses<br>And much more!</p><p>It is clear that all organisms have highly developed mechanisms for self-repair and healing -- but according to Dr. Weil, Western medicine often interferes instead of working with these systems. In the course of his argument, he describes several extraordinary case studies of drastic spontaneous healing. Perhaps the most valuable feature of the book is his more gradual eight-week program of strengthening the ability of your immune, endocrine, circulatory, and nervous systems to provide such spontaneous healing.I think my mother is the long lost sister of Dr. Andrew Weil, author of Spontaneous Healing. As children, my brothers and sisters and I went to the doctor only for yearly check-ups. If we had a cough or cold, we would not be rushed to the doctor's office. For a few days we were treated with orange juice, chicken noodle soup, Vicks Vapo-Rub and TLC, until our bodies recovered, and this turned into our one illness of the year. A lot of my friends, however, who were always being rushed to the doctor, were also always being diagnosed with something or other and spent the winter months on antibiotics. Was I just generally more healthy? Maybe. But it seems now that to some extent my mother was mirroring the teachings of Dr. Weil, and letting our bodies respond to whatever was making us sick. <br>-- JMC</p><h2>The Crown of Sanctity: On the Revelations of Jesus to Luisa Piccarreta (The Revelations of Jesus on the Divine Will to the Servant of God Luisa Piccarreta)</h2><p>2,000 years ago, the Son of God prayed to His Father, &#x201c;Thy Will be done on earth as it is in Heaven.&#x201d; This prayer, the greatest ever uttered by the lips of man, will not go unanswered. Jesus has revealed to an Italian mystic named Luisa that the time has now at last arrived for its fulfillment; that is, for the restoration of what was destroyed by Adam 6,000 years ago in the Fall of Man. In brief:<b> the entire world is about to be radically transformed like never before in its history. </b>This is probably something you should know about. This book has been written to inform you about the transformation and to enable you to take part in it and hasten it. But this transformation will not be achieved through human effort. It will be given directly from Heaven by way of God's greatest Gift: the Gift of Living in the Divine Will, which is the Crown of Sanctity, and which even now we must all strive to receive. In this sanctity is found The Culmination of Deification, the Fruitfulness of Mystical Marriage, the Aspiration of the Unification of Wills, and the Essence of Marian Consecration. This is none other than the Triumph of the Immaculate Heart of Mary promised at Fatima. It is the coming of the Kingdom of God.This is a long book, but its length should turn away no one, as a thorough and detailed table of contents is given so that each reader can easily select only those sections in which he is interested for his perusal.And any reader is sure to find much that interests him. Within these pages is a treasury of resources; not only concerning Luisa's revelations directly, but also on new arguments for God's existence and the truth of Christianity, extensive Catechesis on Private Revelation in general and on the spiritual life in general (including overviews of the greatest teachings on spirituality in the history of the Church), and details on the Era of Peace as revealed to Luisa and many other mystics, visionaries, and seers (Fatima, Medjugorje, Venerable Conchita, Fr. Gobbi, and dozens more).

Surfing is also about a deep admiration and respect for the ocean, as well as the feeling of insignificance when confronted with the forces of nature. Surfers use the waves for fun, but also to forget and to battle, both with others and with themselves.<br><br>Vanfleteren looks beyond the traditional borders of the United States and Australia and searches the globe for people who live in places where sea and land meet. He documents a fluid community, with nature as its sole leader. He has sought out young talent, living icons, and old legends, both competitive and free surfers. <br><br>The photographs here are serene black and white portraits in Vanfleteren's well-known, haunting style; as always, he reaches below the surface and goes to the core of his subjects.

The fate of entire platoons rests on her keen sense of smell. She's a Big Deal, and she likes it that way. Sometimes Cracker remembers when she was younger, and her previous owner would feed her hot dogs and let her sleep in his bed. That was nice, too.&nbsp; <br> Rick Hanski is headed to Vietnam. There, he's going to whip the world and prove to his family and his sergeant -- and everyone else who didn't think he was cut out for war -- wrong. But sometimes Rick can't help but wonder that maybe everyone else <i>is</i> right. Maybe he should have just stayed at home and worked in his dad's hardware store. <br> <br> When Cracker is paired with Rick, she isn't so sure about this new owner. He's going to have to prove himself to <i>her</i> before <i>she's</i> going to prove herself to him. They need to be friends before they can be a team, and they <i>have</i> to be a team if they want to get home alive. <br> <br> Told in part through the uncanny point of view of a German shepherd, <i>Cracker!</i> is an action-packed glimpse into the Vietnam War as seen through the eyes of a dog and her handler.

She lives with her hockey-playing son and dog in West Covina, California.In this fascinating dog story with a twist, Cracker, an intelligent German Shepherd, sadly has to leave his boy, Willie. He is trained and sent to Vietnam, where he and his handler, Rick, search for mines, sniff out enemy locations, and rescue missing soldiers. Despite the quirkiness of telling the story partly through the dog's viewpoint, this production is filled with authentic, gritty details of the realities of war. Kimberly Farr's voice is steady, calm, and reassuring, qualities that are helpful in tempering the emotional intensity and heart-wrenching suspense. Her accents sometimes sound forced, but she brings genuine expression to the main characters, Willie, Rick, and Cracker. And she delivers a terrifically hearty "Woof!"

Where most of his colleagues looked at a battlefield map of World War II&#x2019;s African theater and saw a protracted struggle with Rommel&#x2019;s desert forces, Stirling saw an opportunity: given a small number of elite, well-trained men, he could parachute behind enemy lines and sabotage their airplanes and war material. Paired with his constitutional opposite, the disciplined martinet Jock Lewes, Stirling assembled a revolutionary fighting force that would upend not just the balance of the war, but the nature of combat itself. He faced no little resistance from those who found his tactics ungentlemanly or beyond the pale, but in the SAS&#x2019;s remarkable exploits facing the Nazis in the Africa and then on the Continent can be found the seeds of nearly all special forces units that would follow.<br>&nbsp;<br>Bringing his keen eye for psychological detail to a riveting wartime narrative, Ben Macintyre uses his unprecedented access to SAS archives to shine a light inside a legendary unit long shrouded in secrecy. The result is not just a tremendous war story, but a fascinating group portrait of men of whom history and country asked the most.</p><p>BEN MACINTYRE is a writer-at-large for The Times of London and the bestselling author of <i>A Spy Among Friends</i>, <i>Double Cross</i>, <i>Operation Mincemeat</i>, and <i>Agent Zigzag</i>, among other books. Macintyre has also written and presented BBC documentaries of his work.Chapter 1<br><br> Cowboy Soldier<br><br> Five months before Operation Squatter, a tall, thin soldier lay, grumpy and immobile, in a Cairo hospital bed. The twenty-five-year-old officer had been brought into the Scottish Military Hospital on June 15, 1941, paralyzed from the waist down. A letter to his mother from the War Office stated that he had suffered &#x201c;a contusion of the back as a result of enemy action.&#x201d;<br><br> This was not, strictly speaking, true. The injured soldier had not set eyes on the enemy: he had jumped out of a plane, without a helmet or proper training, ripped his parachute on the tail and plummeted to earth at roughly twice the recommended speed. The impact had knocked him out and badly injured his spine, leaving him temporarily blinded and without feeling in his legs. The doctors feared he would never walk again.<br><br> Even before his parachuting accident, the officer&#x2019;s contribution to the war effort had been minimal: he lacked the most basic military discipline, could not march straight, and was so lazy his comrades had nicknamed him &#x201c;the Giant Sloth.&#x201d; Since being posted to Egypt with the British commando force, he had spent much of his time in Cairo&#x2019;s bars and clubs, or gambling at the racecourse. The nurses at the hospital knew him well, for he frequently popped in during the morning, whey-faced and liverish, to request a blast from the oxygen bottle to cure his hangover. Before his parachute jump landed him in the hospital, he had been under investigation&nbsp;to establish whether he was malingering and ought to be court-martialed. His fellow officers found him charming and entertaining; his senior commanders, for the most part, regarded him as impertinent, incompetent, and profoundly irritating. On completing officer training, he had received a blunt appraisal: &#x201c;irresponsible and unremarkable.&#x201d;<br><br> Lieutenant David Stirling of the Scots Guards was not a conventional soldier.<br><br> The writer Evelyn Waugh, a fellow officer in the commando force, came to visit Stirling about three weeks after his admission to the hospital. Waugh had been misinformed by the matron that one of Stirling&#x2019;s legs had already been amputated, and he would likely lose the other. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t feel a thing,&#x201d; Stirling told his friend. Embarrassed, as Englishmen tend to be when faced with disability, Waugh kept up a steady stream of meaningless small talk, perched on the edge of the bed, and studiously avoided the subject of his friend&#x2019;s paralysis. Every so often, however, he would sneak a surreptitious glance to where Stirling&#x2019;s remaining leg ought to be, and whenever he did so Stirling, with extreme effort, would wiggle the big toe of his right foot. Finally, Waugh realized he was being teased, and hit Stirling with a pillow.<br><br> &#x201c;You bastard, Stirling, when did it happen?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Minutes before you came. It takes a bit of effort, but it&#x2019;s a start.&#x201d;<br><br> Stirling was regaining the use of his legs. Others might have cried for joy; for Stirling, however, the first sign of his recovery was an excellent opportunity to play a practical joke on one of Britain&#x2019;s greatest novelists.<br><br> It would take two more weeks before Stirling could stand upright, and several more before he was able to hobble about. But during those two months of enforced inaction he did a great deal of thinking&#x2014;something that, in spite of his reputation as a feckless gadabout, he was rather good at.<br><br> The commandos were intended to be Britain&#x2019;s storm troops, volunteers selected and trained to carry out destructive raids&nbsp;against Axis targets. Prime Minister Winston Churchill had decided that the ideal theater in which to deploy the commandos would be North Africa, where they could conduct seaborne raids against enemy bases along the Mediterranean coast.<br><br> In Stirling&#x2019;s unsolicited opinion, the concept was not working. Most of the time the commandos were inactive, awaiting the order for a great assault that never came; on the rare occasions when they were deployed, the results had been disappointing. The German and Italian troops fully expected to be attacked from the sea, and were primed and waiting. The commando forces were simply too large and cumbersome to launch an assault without being spotted; the element of surprise was immediately lost.<br><br> But what, wondered Stirling, if the combat troops attacked from the opposite direction? To the south, stretching between Egypt and Libya, lay the Great Sand Sea, a vast, waterless expanse of unbroken dunes covering forty-five thousand square miles. One of the most inhospitable environments on earth, the desert was considered by the Germans to be virtually impassable, a natural barrier, and they therefore left it largely unprotected, and entirely unpatrolled. &#x201c;This was one sea the Hun was not watching,&#x201d; Stirling reflected. If mobile teams of highly trained men, under cover of darkness, could be infiltrated onto the enemy&#x2019;s desert flank, they might be able to sabotage airfields, supply depots, communications links, railways, and roads, and then slip back into the embracing emptiness of the sand sea. A commando force several hundred strong could attack only one target at a time; but a number of smaller units, moving quickly, raiding suddenly and then retreating swiftly, could destroy multiple targets simultaneously. The opportunity to attack the enemy in the rear, when he least expects it, is the pipe dream of every general. The peculiar geography of North Africa offered just such a possibility, reflected Stirling, as he lay half paralyzed in his hospital bed, trying to wiggle his toes.<br><br> Stirling&#x2019;s idea was the result of wishful thinking more than expertise; it had emerged not from long hours of reflection and&nbsp;study, but from the acute boredom of convalescence. It was based on intuition, imagination, and self-confidence, of which Stirling had plenty, rather than experience of desert warfare, of which he had none. But it was an inspired idea, and the sort of idea that could only have occurred to someone as strange and remarkable as Archibald David Stirling.<br><br> Stirling was one of those people who thrive in war, having failed at peace. In a short life, he had tried his hand at a variety of occupations&#x2014;artist, architect, cowboy, and mountaineer&#x2014;and found success in none of them. Privileged by birth and education, intelligent and resourceful, he could have done anything, but had spent the early part of his life doing little of any consequence. The war was his salvation.<br><br> The Stirling family was one of the oldest and grandest in Scotland, an aristocratic clan of great distinction, long military traditions, and considerable eccentricity. David Stirling&#x2019;s mother was the daughter of Lord Lovat, the chief of Clan Fraser, with bloodlines stretching back to Charles II. His father, General Archibald Stirling, had been gassed in the First World War, served as an MP, and then retired to Keir, the fifteen thousand-acre Perthshire estate that had been the family&#x2019;s seat for the previous five centuries. The general presided over his sprawling lands and unruly family like some benign but distant chieftain observing a battlefield from a remote hill. David&#x2019;s formidable mother, Margaret, was the more forceful presence: her children were in awe of her. Keir House, where David Stirling was born in 1915, was a vast edifice, freezing cold even at the height of summer, filled with old hunting trophies, noise, and devilment. The Stirling parents drummed good manners into their six children, but otherwise largely left them to get on with their lives. The four Stirling boys, of whom David was the second in age, grew up stalking deer, hunting rabbits, fighting, and competing. One favorite game was a form of sibling duel using air rifles: two brothers would take potshots at each other&#x2019;s backsides in turn, moving closer by a pace after each shot.<br><br> Despite this aristocratically spartan start in life, David Stirling was not a hardy child. Dispatched to Ampleforth, a Catholic boarding school, at the age of eight, he caught typhoid fever and was sent home for an extended period of recovery. A speech impediment was eventually cured by surgery. He disliked sports, and did his best to avoid them. He grew at an astonishing rate: by the age of seventeen, he was nearly six feet, six inches tall, a gangly beanpole, willful, reckless, and exceptionally polite. Largely by virtue of his class, he was awarded a place at Cambridge University, where he misbehaved on a lavish scale, spending more time at Newmarket racecourse than he devoted to studying. &#x201c;If there was a serious side to life it totally escaped me,&#x201d; he later admitted. If he ever opened a book, the event was not recorded. After a year, the master of his college informed him that he was being sent down, read out a list of twenty-three offenses that merited expulsion, and invited him to select the three that he considered &#x201c;would be least offensive&#x201d; to his mother.<br><br> David Stirling decided he would become an artist, in Paris. He had little talent for painting. But he did have a beret, and a yen for the bohemian life. Some have detected &#x201c;a strange mixture of beauty and the macabre&#x201d; in his paintings. His French art tutor, however, did not, and after a year and a half of louche Left Bank life, he was told that while he might one day make a half-decent commercial draftsman, his &#x201c;painting would never achieve any real merit.&#x201d; Stirling was profoundly upset; his failure as an artist marked him forever, and perhaps explained the consistent ripple of insecurity that lay beneath the carapace of confidence.<br><br> He returned to Cambridge to study architecture, but soon dropped out again. A job with an Edinburgh architect was short-lived. His mother now intervened, and told her second son that he must stop drifting and do something with his life. Stirling&nbsp;announced that he intended to become the first person to climb Mount Everest.<br><br> Stirling was quite the wrong shape to scramble up rocks. He had little experience of serious climbing. He also suffered from vertigo. Intrepid British mountaineers had been trying to scale the world&#x2019;s highest mountain since 1921; dozens had perished in the attempt. Climbing Everest was an expensive, dangerous, demanding business, and Stirling was broke&#x2014;none of which dented his determination to succeed where other, qualified, experienced, well-funded mountaineers had failed. He spent a year climbing in the Swiss Alps, bankrolled by his mother, before joining the supplementary reserve of the Scots Guards, his father&#x2019;s regiment, in the hope that part-time army training might bolster his mountaineering quest. He soon drifted out of uniform, repelled by the mind-swamping boredom of the parade ground. In 1938, at the age of twenty-three, he went to the United States with the intention of climbing the Rockies and riding across the Continental Divide. He was south of the Rio Grande, having spent several months herding cattle in the company of a cowboy named Roy &#x201c;Panhandle&#x201d; Terrill when he learned that Britain was at war&#x2014;the run-up to which had, it seems, almost entirely passed him by. His mother sent a telegram: &#x201c;Return home by the cheapest possible means.&#x201d; Stirling flew to Britain on a first-class ticket, and rushed back into uniform.<br><br> The David Stirling who turned up at the Guards Depot in Pirbright in the autumn of 1939 was a strange mixture of parts. Ambitious but unfocused; steeped in soldierly traditions but allergic to military discipline. A boisterous exterior belied a man prone to periodic depressions, whose extreme good manners and social ease masked moments of inner turmoil. Stirling was a romantic, with an innate talent for friendship but little desire or need for physical intimacy. He appears to have lost his virginity in Paris as an art student. With Panhandle Terrill he had enjoyed the company of &#x201c;some of those dark girls down in Mexico.&#x201d; But his natural shyness coupled with a stern all-male Catholic education seems to&nbsp;have left him in fear of women. &#x201c;The totally confused, guilt-ridden years of puberty exerted an awful pressure,&#x201d; he once remarked. He spoke of &#x201c;predatory females&#x201d;; his few romantic encounters were described as &#x201c;close escapes,&#x201d; as if he feared entrapment. &#x201c;Bonds of any sort are a pressure I find very difficult to bear,&#x201d; he admitted. He had many women friends, and according to his biographer was &#x201c;not unattracted to the opposite sex.&#x201d; Yet he seemed to relax only among men, and &#x201c;in wide open spaces.&#x201d; Like many convivial people, he was slightly lonely. A warrior monk, he craved action and the company of soldiers, but when the fighting was over, he embraced solitude.<br><br> Stirling was also possessed of a profound self-belief, the sort of confidence that comes from high birth and boundless opportunity. He was blithely unconstrained by convention, and regarded rules as nuisances to be ignored, broken, or otherwise overcome. He was elaborately respectful toward his social inferiors, and showed no deference whatever to rank. Strikingly modest, he was repelled by braggarts and loudmouths: &#x201c;swanks&#x201d; (swanking) or &#x201c;pomposo&#x201d; (pomposity) were his gravest insults. His manner seemed vague and forgetful, but his powers of concentration were phenomenal. Despite an ungainly body and a patchy academic record, he had a stubborn faith in his own abilities, intellectual and physical. Stirling did exactly what he wanted to do, whether or not others thought his aims were sensible or even possible. The SAS came into being, in part, because its founder would not take no for an answer, either from those in authority or from those under his command.<br><br> Just as he had been bored by the logistics of mountaineering, so Stirling found the practical preparations for war indescribably tedious. Like many young men, he was hungry for the fight, but instead found himself shackled to a regime of endless marching, kit inspections, weapons drill, and all the other rote elements of military life. So he rebelled. Slipping away from the Guards Depot at Pirbright, he would frequently head to London for a night of drinking, gambling, and billiards at White&#x2019;s club; just as frequently&nbsp;he was caught, and confined to barracks. Stirling was a nightmare recruit: impertinent, indolent, and often half asleep as a result of his carousing the night before. &#x201c;He was quite, quite irresponsible,&#x201d; recalled Willie (later Viscount) Whitelaw, a fellow trainee officer at Pirbright. &#x201c;He just couldn&#x2019;t tolerate that we were being trained along the lines of the last major conflict. His reaction was just to ignore everything.&#x201d;<br><br> It was at the bar of White&#x2019;s, one of the most exclusive gentleman&#x2019;s clubs in London, that Stirling first learned about a form of soldiering that seemed much closer to the adventure and excitement he had in mind: a crack new commando unit intended to hit important enemy targets with maximum impact. Stirling&#x2019;s cousin, Lord Lovat, had been among the first to volunteer for the commandos.<br><br> Formed under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Robert Laycock, the force&#x2014;christened Layforce&#x2014;would consist of more than 1,500 volunteers formed into three commando regiments, recruited from the Foot Guards (the regular infantry of the Household Division) and other infantry regiments: an elite troop of specialized, highly trained raiders and marauders.

Ten years ago Anne Byrn's The Cake Mix Doctor began its extraordinary run as one of the most popular baking books of all time. Now Anne Byrn is back with the all-new Cake Mix Doctor Returns! From the beloved author who showed home bakers how adding a touch of sweet butter or a dusting of cocoa powder, a dollop of vanilla yogurt or flurry of grated lemon zest could transform the ordinary into the extraordinary. Here are 160 brand-new recipes. That&#x2019;s right, 160 amazing cake mix recipes for luscious layer cakes, sheet cakes, brownies, bars, cookies, and more. And the book is needed more than ever. Today 90 percent of home cooks use prepackaged mixes, while the economy is creating a perfect excuse to let them eat cake: cake equals happiness. And what cakes! 40 layer cakes, from Tiramisu Cake to The Best Red Velvet Cake, Strawberry Refrigerator Cake to Chocolate Swirled Cannoli Cake. 35 sheet cakes. 38 bundt and pound cakes. 16 cupcakes and muffins, plus the cult classic Whoopie Pie.

Drawn from those talks, this new work reveals what sustained Nouwen to remain faithful to the teachings of Jesus and led him to become an icon of compassion and vulnerability. Here he writes eloquently about calling and purpose, fear and hope. And he explains why&#x2014;with so many choices available to the twenty-first-century seeker&#x2014;the greatest reward for those looking for spiritual direction is rediscovering Jesus&#x2019;s teaching on love. Along the way, Nouwen offers warm, insightful, practical habits to help readers navigate the narrow, sometimes arduous, but ultimately fulfilling road of conviction and faith.<br> <b><br>Praise for <i>Following Jesus</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;Few writers have influenced me more than Henri Nouwen. These newly published lectures&nbsp;offer fresh and timely insights amid the familiar cadences of&nbsp;Nouwen&#x2019;s prose, written from a place of deep anxiety but even deeper hope.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;John Inazu, professor of political science, Washington University in St. Louis, author of <i>Confident Pluralism<br><br></i></b>&#x201c;In&nbsp;<i>Following Jesus</i>, beloved pastor and spiritual mentor Henri Nouwen guides the reader on the journey he has traveled as a follower of Jesus. Without minimizing the anxieties, fears, and brokenness that touch down in every reader&#x2019;s story, Nouwen gently leads the way into a life that centers on Jesus and engulfs the follower with God&#x2019;s love, a sense of belonging, and a purpose that endures.&nbsp;Truly a wise and welcome word for anyone in this age of anxiety.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Carolyn Custis James, author of&nbsp;<i>Half the Church: Recapturing God&#x2019;s Global Vision for Women&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Finding God in the Margins</i></b></p><p><b>Henri J.

So they went and saw where he lived and they stayed with him the rest of the day. It was about the tenth hour.<br>John 1:35&#x2013;39</p><p>Imagine you are in this story for a moment. Imagine you are there with John the Baptist. He was a tough man. Picture him dressed in camel hair. He is separate from others. With a stern voice he says, &#x201c;Repent! Repent! You are sinful people. Repent, repent, repent!&#x201d;</p><p>People are there listening. Somehow they feel that there is something missing in their lives. Somehow they feel that they are busy with many things and exhausted or they are just sitting there and nothing is ever going to happen.</p><p>They go to this strange man&#x2014;this wild man&#x2014;and listen. John and Andrew, two of John&#x2019;s disciples, are there with him. One day Jesus passes by. John looks hard at him and says, &#x201c;That is the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world.&#x201d;</p><p>John knew that his people were sinners and needed to repent, but he also knew that he could not take away the sins of those people; that taking away sins was not a human possibility. He said, &#x201c;Repent, repent, repent!&#x201d; But when Jesus passed by, John looked hard at him, and said to John and Andrew, &#x201c;Look, that is the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world. That is the servant of God. He came to suffer. That is the One who has been sent to become the sacrifice, the Lamb of God, so that he can take away your sins.&#x201d;</p><p>Just be there in this picture.</p><p>Just be there where John and Andrew are, eager to start a new life, with a new focus, a new beginning, a new heart, a new soul. Those two young men start following Jesus, and Jesus turns around and sees them following him and said, &#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d; And what do they say? Do they say, &#x201c;Lord, we want to be your followers,&#x201d; &#x201c;Lord, we want to do your will,&#x201d; &#x201c;Lord, we want you to take our sins away&#x201d;? They don&#x2019;t say any of that! Instead, they ask, &#x201c;Where do you live?&#x201d;</p><p>Somehow, right here in the beginning of the story we hear a very important question: Where do you live? What is your place? What is your way? How is it to be around you?</p><p>Jesus says, &#x201c;Come and see.&#x201d;</p><p>He doesn&#x2019;t say, &#x201c;Come into my world.&#x201d; He doesn&#x2019;t say, &#x201c;Come, I will change you.&#x201d; He doesn&#x2019;t say, &#x201c;Become my disciples,&#x201d; &#x201c;Listen to me,&#x201d; &#x201c;Do what I tell you,&#x201d; &#x201c;Take up your cross.&#x201d; No. He says, &#x201c;Come and see. Look around. Get to know me.&#x201d; That is the invitation.</p><p>They stayed with him. They went and saw where he lived and stayed with him the rest of the day. John says it was about the tenth hour, or four o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon.</p><p>Jesus invited them and they came around him and they dwelled with him. They went willingly to his place. They saw a man very different from John the Baptist, who yelled, &#x201c;Repent, repent, repent! The time has come.&#x201d; Instead, Jesus said, &#x201c;Come see where I live.&#x201d;</p><p>They saw Jesus, the Lamb of God. The humble servant. Poor, gentle, warm, peacemaker, pure of heart. They saw him. Already then. They saw the Lamb of God.</p><p>There is a softness. There is a gentleness. There is a humility.</p><p>&#x201c;Come and see.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They stayed with him for the rest of the day.&#x201d;</p><p>Jesus invites them in to just look around.</p><p>Be there. Look with the eyes of the heart to the story you have heard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We Are Invited</p><p>Jesus is offering an invitation to come into the House of God. It is an invitation to enter into God&#x2019;s dwelling place.</p><p>It is not an invitation with harsh demands. It is the story of the Lamb of God saying to us, &#x201c;Come. Come to my home. Look around. Don&#x2019;t be afraid.&#x201d; Long before Jesus&#x2019; radical call to leave everything behind, Jesus says, &#x201c;Come, have a look where I am.&#x201d;</p><p>Jesus is a host who wants us around him. Jesus is the Good Shepherd of the Old Testament who invites his people to his table where the cup of life overflows.</p><p>This image of God inviting us to his home is used throughout scripture.&nbsp;</p><p>The Lord is my house. The Lord is my hiding place. The Lord is my awning.</p><p>The Lord is my refuge. The Lord is my tent. The Lord is my temple. The Lord is my dwelling place. The Lord is my home. The Lord is the place where I want to dwell all the days of my life.</p><p>God wants to be our room, our house. He wants to be anything that makes us feel at home. She is like a bird hugging us under her wings. She is like a woman holding us in her womb. She is Infinite Mother, Loving Host, Caring Father, the Good Provider who invites us to join Him.</p><p>There is a sense of being that is safe, that is good. In this dangerous world full of violence, chaos, and destruction, there is this place where we want to be. We want to be in the House of God&#x2014;to feel safe, to be embraced, to be loved, to be cared for. With the psalmist we say, &#x201c;Where else does my heart want to stay but in the House of the Lord?&#x201d; (See Psalms 84 and 27.)</p><p>The word &#x201c;home&#x201d; continues to grow in significance. Jesus says, &#x201c;I am going to the house of my Father to prepare a room for you because in the house of my Father there are many dwelling places&#x201d; (John 14:2). Jesus tells us about that great home, that mansion, where we&#x2019;ll have a banquet and the cup is overflowing, where life will be one great celebration.</p><p>John&#x2019;s Gospel opens with an incredible vision of home. &#x201c;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, and in the Word everything was created, and the Word became flesh and pitched its tent among us&#x201d; (John 1:1&#x2013;3, 14). Home is what the incarnation is all about. If you read the Gospel you hear how Jesus speaks: &#x201c;I have made my home in you so you can make your home in me&#x201d; (John 15:4&#x2013;8). This vision of the House of God goes deeper and deeper. Suddenly, all these images merge and we realize that we are God&#x2019;s home and that we are invited to make our home where God has made God&#x2019;s home. We realize that right where we are, right here in this body, with this face, with these hands, with this heart, we are the place where God can dwell.</p><p>Listen carefully: Jesus wants you and me to become part of the intimate family of God. &#x201c;Just as the Father loves me so I love you&#x201d; (John 15:9). Jesus says, &#x201c;You are no longer slaves, strangers and outsiders; no, you are friends because everything I have heard from my Father is yours, all the works I do you can do, and even greater ones. I am not the great person and you the little one&#x2014;no, all that I can do, you can do too&#x201d; (John 15:15&#x2013;16).</p><p>The intimate relationship between the Father and the Son has a name. It is Spirit. Holy Spirit. &#x201c;I want you to have my Spirit.&#x201d; &#x201c;Spirit&#x201d; means &#x201c;breath.&#x201d; It comes from the ancient Greek word pneuma. &#x201c;I want you to have my breathing. I want you to have that most intimate part of me so that the relationship that is between you and God is the same as between me and God, which is a divine relationship.&#x201d;</p><p>What you need to hear with your heart is that you are invited to dwell in the family of God. You are invited to be part of that intimate communion right now.</p><p>The spiritual life means you are part of the family of God.</p><p>When we say &#x201c;I say this in the name of Jesus&#x201d; or &#x201c;I do this in the name of Jesus,&#x201d; we really mean &#x201c;I do it from the place of God.&#x201d; A lot of people today think that if we do something in the name of Jesus it is because Jesus is not there so we do it as a representative of his. But that is not what it means. To speak in the name of Jesus, to dwell in the name of Jesus, to act in the name of Jesus, means that the name is where I am. Where are you? &#x201c;I am alive in the name and that is where I dwell, that is where my home is.&#x201d; Once you are living there, you can go out into the world without ever leaving that place.</p><p>Outside of that place, outside of the heart of Jesus, all of our words and all of our thoughts add up to nothing. Whatever you do, never leave that place, because only in that place are you in God. Only from that place comes salvation, and salvation is what we have to bring forth into this world.</p><p>The invitation is &#x201c;Come and see the place of God.&#x201d; In the beginning we think it is just his home, his physical place, but as the Gospel of John develops, John shows us that the place of God is the intimate life of God himself&#x2014;the Father, Son, and Spirit who form a family of love into which we are invited. Following Jesus is the way to enter into that family of love.</p><p>We do not have to follow Jesus. First is the invitation. &#x201c;Come, come. Come and see.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>No Promises in the Wind</h2><p><b>From the Newbery Award-winning author of <i>Across Five Aprils</i> and <i>Up a Road Slowly</i> comes a tale of a brave young man&#x2019;s struggle to find his own strength during the Great Depression.<br><br><b>&#x201c;A powerfully moving story.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Chicago Daily News</i></b></b><br><br>In 1932, American's dreams were simple: a job, food to eat, a place to sleep, and shoes without holes.

Yet she came to adopt the view that men and women have different roles in marriage and ministry, and that fulfilling such roles pleases God and leads to greater personal fulfillment.</p><p>In this unapologetic but nuanced piece, Keller presents a caring and careful case for biblical gender differences and the complementarian view of women in ministry. At the same time, she encourages women to teach and lead in the church in ways that may startle some complementarians. Readers on both sides of this hot-button topic will be challenged by her ministry-tested and thoroughly Scriptural perspective.</p></p><p><p>Kathy Keller was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and attended Allegheny College. She graduated from Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary in 1975 with her MA in Theological Studies. She and her husband, Tim, married one semester before graduation. West Hopewell Presbyterian Church in Hopewell, Virginia, extended a call for Tim to be a three-month interim pastor while they searched for someone more experienced. Nine years and three sons later, the Kellers moved to Philadelphia, where Tim taught at Westminster Theological Seminary and Kathy began work as an editor at Great Commission Publications.</p> <p>In 1989 they moved to Manhattan to plant Redeemer Presbyterian Church. As staff were added, Kathy focused on the Communication Committee. She is now the Assistant<em> </em>Director of Communication and Media and the editor at Redeemer. She also writes and speaks along with Tim. Their three sons are grown and married, and producing amazing grandchildren. They and their families are all members of Redeemer.&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Dandelions</h2><p>Embarking on a new life, Zoe and her family journey west to the Nebraska Territory in the 1800s.<br> When Zoe and her family arrive at their claim, nothing distinguishes it from the miles and miles of surrounding prairie. Even after they build their soddie, the home can't be seen from any distance. Zoe has never seen Papa so happy or Mama so sad. But when she takes a trip to the small prairie town with Papa, Zoe sees something that might make a difference to their new soddie, and to Mama's life, too.<br></p><p><p>Eve Bunting has written&nbsp;over two hundred&nbsp;books for children, including the Caldecott Medal-winning <i>Smoky Night,</i> illustrated by David Diaz, <i>The Wall</i>,<i> Fly Away Home</i>, and <i>Train to Somewhere</i>. She lives in Southern California.</p>Kindergarten-Grade 3?Looking for a better life, a pioneer father moves his pregnant wife and daughters west. Both Zoe and Rebecca recognize their mother's isolation and depression as they arrive at their claim stake in the middle of the prairie, and try to work extra hard to please her. Zoe's first-person account describes a visit to neighbors (only three hours away) and a trip to town for supplies, where she finds something that she hopes will help cheer her mother: a clump of dandelions, which she and her father speculate came west as a seed on a wagon. They plant it on the roof of their sod home, and the story ends with the clump looking dry and lifeless. However, the closing words indicate that the family feels more hopeful about their prairie life to come; the last picture shows a panoramic view of their farm of the future, with the dandelions covering the roof and the fields plowed and fertile. The gouache on canvas paintings are grand and sweeping; they emphasize the vast expanse of open land that dwarfs and seems to swallow up everything that comes in contact with it. The characters are frequently shown in deep shadow underneath sun hats, as the sun blazes down on them. When their faces are shown, there is a hazy lack of focus in an almost impressionistic style that heightens the centrality of place and climate, rather than individual character. Yet these people make their mark and find their place; modern readers will identify with this family's experiences and concerns, and will admire their adventurous spirits. Bunting tells a poignant story, which is made even more affecting by its lovely illustrations.?Ruth K.

As he would later write in the first of a series of award-winning columns for Vanity Fair, he suddenly found himself being deported "from the country of the well across the stark frontier that marks off the land of malady." Over the next eighteen months, until his death in Houston on December 15, 2011, he wrote constantly and brilliantly on politics and culture, astonishing readers with his capacity for superior work even in extremis.<br>Throughout the course of his ordeal battling esophageal cancer, Hitchens adamantly and bravely refused the solace of religion, preferring to confront death with both eyes open. In this riveting account of his affliction, Hitchens poignantly describes the torments of illness, discusses its taboos, and explores how disease transforms experience and changes our relationship to the world around us. By turns personal and philosophical, Hitchens embraces the full panoply of human emotions as cancer invades his body and compels him to grapple with the enigma of death.<b><br></b><b>MORTALITY</b> is the exemplary story of one man's refusal to cower in the face of the unknown, as well as a searching look at the human predicament. Crisp and vivid, veined throughout with penetrating intelligence, Hitchens's testament is a courageous and lucid work of literature, an affirmation of the dignity and worth of man.<br></p><p><b>Amazon Best Books of the Month, September 2012:</b> Curious and prolific to the end, combative writer Christopher Hitchens leaves us with a posthumously published analysis of his dying days. <i>Mortality</i> is the anti&#x2013;<i>Last Lecture</i>: Stripping away semantics and sentimentality, Hitchens treats his cancer as he would any other topic--with dogged inquisitiveness and brutal honesty. Which makes it all the more poignant when he begins losing his voice, his "freedom of speech," and sinks deeper into his "year of living dyingly." Funny, smart, irreverent, and surprisingly moving, this lucid, unflinching end-of-life journey through "Tumorville" is brave and powerful stuff. The unfinished jottings that comprise the final pages are a heartbreaking display of a mind that never stopped till the very end. --<i>Neal Thompson</i>Christopher Hitchens was a contributing editor to <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>Slate</i>, and <i>The Atlantic</i>, and the author of numerous books, including works on Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, and George Orwell. He also wrote the international bestsellers <i>god Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything</i>, <i>Hitch-22: A Memoir</i>, and <i>Arguably</i>.

This book is as good as it is dangerous, and I found it to be extremely good, which makes it extremely dangerous. <p>The author delves first into the psychology of men from the point of view of a man, openly admitting that the male species does have certain soft spots that any woman can exploit. As I poured myself a glass of wine, I let the earlier chapters linger. </p><p>As a happily married woman, I have no need for Tactics, but as I sat back down to read, I found out that I was being na�ve. By the time I finished the chapters on flirting, phone sex, and asking for gifts in the proper way, I was on my second glass of wine and thinking of trying these things on my husband (just a smudge) to see if it would net a better birthday gift this year. </p><p>The second part of the book builds on the first twelve chapters and signals an advanced stage where those women who don t mind going the extra mile sexually can master things like online dating and my personal favorite, The Kardashian Effect. Through it all, the author G.L. Lambert makes this a highly entertaining read even for us non-Hos, with his pop-culture infused sense of humor and sleek use of analogies that helped even a non-hip woman such as me keep up with the steps. </p><p>My only negative take away was that, while it does preach about the ills of this lifestyle, it does serve it up as a huge temptation. The chapter on going from Ho to Housewife I fear could influence younger women to take up this charge. With that said, I did learn something, which in itself blew away my expectations (while putting a smile on my husband's face). </p><p>I highly recommend Ho Tactics, but only to those women over 21 years of age, I figure that you should be of drinking age before you come of Hoing age. --Urban League Digest</p></p><h2>Wisconsin Supper Club Cookbook: Iconic Fare and Nostalgia from Landmark Eateries</h2><p>The supper club is a tradition and now somewhat of a phenomenon found in the Upper Midwestern states of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, and Iowa.

With Raymond Floyd as your teacher, you are sure to shoot the lowest scores you can, day in and day out, playing the game like a true scorer.</p><p>Playing golf isn't hard; it's playing it well when you're not on your game that's difficult, and few have ever mastered that skill better than former Masters, U.S. Open, and PGA champion Raymond Floyd. One of the fiercest competitors on the fairways, he's as tough with his mind as he is with his clubs; <i>Elements</i> is his primer on how to think like a golfer. More so than any swing tip or technical adjustment, his advice on how to live with bad shots has the potential to lower scores dramatically. Floyd sets up various adverse situations and suggests ways to play through them, but his most important bits of wisdom are more generic than specific: learn what mistakes you can afford to make, and always have a dependable "safety shot" at your disposal when all else seems lost. Golf is less a game of perfection than one of survival and recovery. Floyd's <i>Elements</i>, then, is a comprehensive guide to posting scores you can be proud of on those rough days. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i>Raymond Floyd has won 35 official tournaments (22 on the regular tour, 13 on the senior tour), including four majors. He made history in 1992 when he became the first player to win on both the PGA Tour and the Senior Tour in the same year. He lives in Palm Beach, Florida.</p><h2>Girls Can Do Anything: An Empowering Book for Children (Feminist Girl Power, Inclusive Gifts for Toddlers, Baby Book About Self Esteem)</h2><p><b><i>Girls come in all different colors and sizes. <br> They delight and amaze us. <br> They're full of surprises.<br> Girls can do anything they want to do.<br> And if YOU are a girl . . . <br> You can do these things too!</i></b> <br><br>Give that special girl in your life wings to fly with this enchanting book that's all about the things girls can do.

Refreshingly, some are depicted using wheelchairs or wearing glasses or hijabs. The infectious, cheerleaderlike tone is unsurprising and repeats the anthem "I'm a GIRL! I'm FANTASTIC! I'm strong, brave, and proud!" The cartoony, energetic artwork is appealing overall, with front endpapers presenting a gallery of possible career choices.

In the early-morning hours of June 28, 1969, the Stonewall Inn was raided by police in New York City. Though the inn had been raided before, that night would be different. It would be the night when empowered members of the LGBTQ+ community--in and around the Stonewall Inn--began to protest and demand their equal rights as citizens of the United States. Movingly narrated by the Stonewall Inn itself, and featuring stirring and dynamic illustrations, <i>Stonewall: A Building. An Uprising.

These VeggieTales stars are the most famous vegetables you'll ever eat. Oops, meet. Their antics are known around the world. But so much of the VeggieTales story hasn't been told. In <em>Me, Myself, and Bob,</em> Phil Vischer, founder of Big Idea and creator of VeggieTales, gives a behind-the-scenes look at his not-so-funny journey with the loveable veggies. From famed creator to bankrupt dreamer, Vischer shares his story of trial and ultimate triumph as God inspired him with one big idea after another.</p></p><p>Phil Vischer is the CEO and Chief Creative Officer of Big Idea Productions. As co-creator of the popular series, VeggieTales (TM), he has also served as writer, director and voice for more than a dozen characters, including Bob the Tomato. Since the release of the first VeggieTales (TM) episode in 1993, more than 30 million units have been sold in the series. Vischer and his wife, Lisa, live in the Chicago, IL with their 3 children.Have you ever been tempted to start your own business? First read this cautionary tale, especially if you think your ideas come from God. Vischer, a pioneer in computerized animation and creator of Veggie Tales, proves that a pathetically skinny, shy techno-geek can be hilarious even when describing his headlong plunge into bankruptcy. In 1989, "with an unflappable 'How hard could it be' attitude," the 22-year-old entrepreneur launched his dream of creating high-quality Christian entertainment by founding the company that would become Big Idea Productions. Thirteen stressful years later, he was featured in a <i>People</i> magazine cover story&#x2014;"small town kid kicked out of Bible college and down to his last ten bucks creates talking vegetables and hits it big, selling 40 million videos!"&#x2014;shortly before firing half his staff in an unsuccessful attempt to avert disaster. While Vischer accepts the blame for the collapse ("my strengths built Big Idea, and my weaknesses brought it down"), he also details various unnamed executives' incompetence. One question haunted him: if he was doing God's work, why didn't God rescue his company? Concluding his story of spiritual inspiration and heartbreak, Vischer draws lessons from his experience for anyone who has ever lost a dream. <i>(Jan. 9)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

After charting jaunts along the Silk Road, on safari, and to the Galapagos in previous books, Krebs offers a fourth globetrotting picture book, this one about a family's appreciative--if idealized--visit to Mexico. On each spread, artwork inspired by the festive colors and distinctive iconography of Mexican folk crafts pairs with Krebs' singsong verse about a place or experience ("We climb amazing pyramids from ancient Mexico / And wonder how they're standing now / When built so long ago"). The family's perambulations too often focus on stock resort-pamphlet fantasies (dancing to mariachis, feasting with the locals) rather than specific sites, lending the book a generic quality exacerbated by the absence of informational text amplifying why the chosen scenes are considered representative. But the armchair-travel element may help rouse young students' enthusiasm for units on Mexico or Cinco de Mayo celebrations, and kids and adults alike will enjoy tackling the abundant Spanish vocabulary, present on every spread and in a glossary, and browsing the concluding map and appendixes. <i>Jennifer Mattson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

As he floats through the sea, Mister Seahorse meets a Mr Stickleback, Mr Tilapia, Mr Kurtus and many other fish fathers caring for their eggs and babies in the most surprising ways.</p><p>Are you ready for a scintillating seahorse fact? The father seahorse is the one who carries the mother's eggs around in his pouch before they hatch. In <i>Mister Seahorse</i>, master collage artist Eric Carle teaches preschoolers this lesson and introduces them to a few other fish who bear the traditionally maternal burden of caring for eggs: the stickleback, tilapia, Kurtus nurseryfish (known here as Mr. Kurtus), pipefish, and bullhead catfish. As ever, it's Carle's art that steals the show. Cut-up tissue paper soaks up the watery paint and makes for a boldly colorful, almost jewel-like undersea journey. The story? Well, repetition is the heart of instruction, after all. <p> Most of Carle's books employ some sort of gizmo or gadget--and this one is no exception. Here, for a splendid lesson in camouflage, colorful acetate sheets mask marine life that is revealed as the child turns the page. Children may take comfort in the devotion of these undersea fathers...except perhaps at the very end when the father seahorse says to a freshly hatched sea-pony who wants back in the pouch: "I <i>do</i> love you, but now you are ready to be on your own."

I never added it to food, or saw Maman add it to food. When my aunt Ziba, who had a well-documented taste for salt, sprinkled it onto her saffron rice at the table each night, my brothers and I giggled. We thought it was the strangest, funniest thing in the world. &#x201c;What on earth,&#x201d; I wondered, &#x201c;can salt do for food?&#x201d;<br> <br>I associated salt with the beach, where I spent my childhood seasoned with it. There were the endless hours in the Pacific, swallowing mouthful after mouthful of ocean water when I misjudged the waves. Tidepooling at twilight, my friends and I often fell victim to the saltwater spray while we poked at anemones. And my brothers, chasing me on the sand with giant kelp, would tickle and taunt me with its salty, otherworldly tassels whenever they caught up to me.<br> <br>Maman always kept our swimsuits in the back of our blue Volvo station wagon, because the beach was always where we wanted to be. She was deft with the umbrella and blankets, setting them up while she shooed the three of us into the sea.<br> <br>We&#x2019;d stay in the water until we were starving, scanning the beach for the sun-faded coral-and-white umbrella, the only landmark that would lead us back to Maman. Wiping saltwater from our eyes, we beelined to her.<br> <br>Somehow, Maman always knew exactly what would taste best when we emerged: Persian cucumbers topped with sheep&#x2019;s milk feta cheese rolled together in lavash bread. We chased the sandwiches with handfuls of ice-cold grapes or wedges of watermelon to quench our thirst.<br> <br>That snack, eaten while my curls dripped with seawater and salt crust formed on my skin, always tasted so good. Without a doubt, the pleasures of the beach added to the magic of the experience, but it wasn&#x2019;t until many years later, working at Chez Panisse, that I understood why those bites had been so perfect from a culinary point of view.<br> <br>While bussing tables during the first year I worked at Chez Panisse, the closest I usually got to the food was at tasters, when the cooks made each dish for the chef to critique before service. With a menu that changed daily, the chef needed tasters to ensure that his or her vision was realized. Everything had to be just right. The cooks would tinker and adjust until satisfied; then they&#x2019;d hand over the dishes to the floor staff to taste. On the tiny back porch, a dozen of us would hover over the plates, passing them around until we&#x2019;d all had a bite of everything. It was there that I first tasted crisp deep-fried quail, tender salmon grilled in a fig leaf, and buttermilk panna cotta with fragrant wild strawberries. Often, the powerful flavors would haunt me throughout my shift.<br> <br>Once I developed culinary aspirations, Chris Lee, the chef who&#x2019;d eventually take me under his wing, suggested that I pay less attention to what was happening on the porch during tasters, and more to what was happening in the kitchen. The language the chefs used, how they knew when something was right&#x2014;these were clues about how to become a better cook. Most often, when a dish fell flat, the answer lay in adjusting the salt. Sometimes it was in the form of salt crystals, but other times it meant a grating of cheese, some pounded anchovies, a few olives, or a sprinkling of capers. I began to see that there is no better guide in the kitchen than thoughtful tasting, and that nothing is more important to taste thoughtfully for than salt.<br> <br>One day the following year, as a young cook in the prep kitchen, I was tasked with cooking polenta. I&#x2019;d tasted polenta only once before coming to Chez Panisse, and I wasn&#x2019;t a fan. Precooked and wrapped in plastic like a roll of cookie dough, it was flavorless. But I&#x2019;d promised myself that I would try everything at the restaurant at least once, and when I tasted polenta for the second time, I couldn&#x2019;t believe that something so creamy and complex could share a name with that flavorless tube of astronaut food. Milled from an heirloom variety of corn, each bite of the polenta at Chez Panisse tasted of sweetness and earth. I couldn&#x2019;t wait to cook some myself.<br> <br>Once the chef, Cal Peternell, talked me through the steps of making the polenta, I began cooking. Consumed by the fear of scorching and ruining the entire humongous pot&#x2014;a mistake I had seen other cooks make&#x2014;I stirred maniacally.<br> <br>After an hour and a half, I&#x2019;d added in butter and Parmesan, just as Cal had instructed me. I brought him a spoonful of the creamy porridge to taste. At six foot four, Cal is a gentle giant with sandy-blond hair and the driest of wits. I looked expectantly up at him with equal parts respect and terror. He said, in his signature deadpan, &#x201c;It needs more salt.&#x201d; Dutifully, I returned to the pot and sprinkled in a few grains of salt, treating them with the preciousness I might afford, say, gold leaf. I thought it tasted pretty good, so I returned to Cal with a spoonful of my newly adjusted polenta.<br> <br>Again, a moment&#x2019;s consideration was all he needed to know the seasoning was off.

I had wanted so badly to do that polenta justice! The degree to which I&#x2019;d been off was exponential. Three palmfuls!<br> <br>Cal grabbed spoons and together we tasted. Some indescribable transformation had occurred. The corn was somehow sweeter, the butter richer. All of the flavors were more pronounced. I&#x2019;d been certain Cal had ruined the pot and turned my polenta into a salt lick, but no matter how I tried, the word salty did not apply to what I tasted. All I felt was a satisfying zing! with each mouthful.<br> <br>It was as if I&#x2019;d been struck by lightning. It&#x2019;d never occurred to me that salt was anything more than pepper&#x2019;s sidekick. But now, having experienced the transformative power of salt for myself, I wanted to learn how to get that zing! every time I cooked. I thought about all of the foods I&#x2019;d loved to eat growing up&#x2014;and that bite of seaside cucumber and feta, in particular. I realized then why it had tasted so good. It was properly seasoned, with salt.<br> <br></p><h2>Lay Servant Ministries, Participant&#39;s Book (Basic Course)</h2><p>I want to grow as a follower of Jesus and better understand how to use my gifts in ministry.

They have not lost their love for Christ, or their desire to serve him. But for one reason or another, they are exhausted and simply cannot carry on.<br><br> Christopher Ash knows this experience all too well. As a pastor of a growing church, and then in his role training people for ministry, he has found himself on the edge of burnout a number of times, and has pastored many younger ministers who have reached the end of their tether.<br><br> His wisdom has been distilled into this short, accessible book, in which he reveals a neglected biblical truth and seven keys that flow from it. Understood properly, and built into our lives as Christians who are zealous to serve the Lord, they will serve to protect us from burnout, and keep us working for God's kingdom and glory.<br><br></p><p>Christopher Ash is a pastor and author. He was Director of the Proclamation Trust&#39;s Cornhill Training Course from 2004-2015. He is married to Carolyn and they have four children and three grandchildren.Books like this are a needed resource for the weary pastor. Christopher Ash draws on years of personal experience and rich biblical wisdom to provide ministers with a tremendously encouraging resource to persevere and thrive in the ministry. This is a book all pastors need to read and take to heart for the sake of their church and for the sake of the fruitfulness of their ministry. <br> -- <b>R. Albert Mohler</b> - President of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary <br><br>Many pastors are familiar with the weariness that accompanies ministry. Like a wise and gentle friend, Christopher Ash provides us with encouragement and practical help so we can sustain zeal and avoid burnout. While this book is a gift to pastors in particular, everyone who reads it will benefit.<br> -- <b>C.J. Mahaney</b> - Sovereign Grace Church of Louisville <br><br>This book is blessedly humbling and helpful. It's full of honest testimony concerning this thing called burnout. I'm grateful to learn from this testimony and from the biblical wisdom that enfolds it. Christopher Ash has given us a call to zeal without burnout - but rather with humility to trust our all-sufficient God who has provided for us in his Son.<br> -- <b>Kathleen Nielson</b> - Author, speaker and Director of Women's Initiatives for The Gospel Coalition <br><br>Exceptionally wise, practical, and important. Pastors aren't the only ones who are prone to burnout. Women's ministry leaders, pastor's wives, and cross-cultural workers, take up and read! Sit down with a friend so you can discuss "Zeal Without Burnout" together. It will give you a whole new appreciation for who our great God is, and who he has designed us to be.<br> -- <b>Gloria Furman</b> - pastor's wife, mom of 4, author of <i>The Pastor's Wife</i> and <i>Missional Motherhood</i> <br><br>Reading Zeal without Burnout by Christopher Ash is like sitting across from a godly father and friend who loves you enough to look you in the eyes and tell you that you that the world is not going to come apart at the seams if you take some time off to take care of yourself. Anyone who worships the god of productivity and therefore has forgotten how to take a break will benefit from this book.<br> -- <b>Nancy Guthrie</b> - Bible teacher and author of the Seeing Jesus in the Old Testament series <br><br>This book is for everyone not just people in ministry because we all live very busy lives and are susceptible to burnout. In Zeal without Burnout, Christopher Ash speaks plainly, wisely and encouragingly. He does so because he has been there. If you want to take a first step by asking whether you are on your way towards or in the midst of burnout, this book will help you. His advise is grounded in a basic understanding of our humanity and our limitations. He then gives practical guidance in light of those limitations. As I read through this easy to read book, I found myself evaluating my own life and found comfort as I recognized my limitations and took to heart his advise. I will be recommending this book to everyone!<br> -- <b>Timothy Lane</b> - Author and President of the Institute for Pastoral Care <br><br> This book will not require much of your time investment cover to cover, but careful digestion of its biblical wisdom will reap dividends a hundred fold and then some. Whatever your temperament, I don't think any Christian worker can afford not to read it. <br> --<b> Adrian Reynolds</b> - Director of Ministry, The Proclamation Trust, UK<br><br>Christopher's exposition of the simple truth that&nbsp;"God is God and we are dust"&nbsp;liberates, humbles and strengthens with practical and pastoral wisdom. Read this if you are feeling weary and be refreshed in God's grace. Read this even if you are feeling energetic because prevention is better than cure!<br> -- <b>Denesh Divyanathan</b> - Founding Pastor of The Crossing Church (Singapore) &amp; President of Project Timothy (Singapore). <br><br>There are far too many victims of burnout in pastoral ministry. I was very nearly one of them and almost had to pull out after just four years. Christopher Ash's wise counsel, learnt from scripture and through long, and sometimes bitter, experience, would have helped me enormously in those early years and is still what I need today.<br> -- <b>Vaughan Roberts</b> - Rector of St Ebbe's Oxford and Director of The Proclamation Trust <br><br>As a pastor of 12 years and no longer young, I praise God for Christopher Ash's self-disclosing cry that we are but dust! We live moment by moment as frail beings given health and strength by our sovereign Father, but those are limited by his grace so that we never forget that he is God, not us, and that we desperately and constantly are constructed so as to need him. May this book help us end the corporate church conspiracy to seem stronger than we are, even omnipotent, and leave us content to keep being wisely weak and daily dependent until Jesus returns.<br> -- <b>Dr. Andrew Nicholls</b> - Medical Doctor and Church Pastor <br><br>This is a brutally honest but profoundly joyful little book. Packed with personal testimony and Biblical insight we are gently reminded of the dangers of behaving like we are God. It is humbling, refreshing and will be a great help to many who want to keep going to the finish line. <br> --<b> Jonty Allcock</b> - Author and lead pastor at The Globe Church, London<br><br>I m so grateful (and relieved!) that someone of Christopher s experience has written so candidly about burnout. Interspersed with several others testimonies, this is a very real, down-to-earth but always wise book. There s straight-talking but a soft heart, compassion for the broken alongside a desire for healthier expectations for normal ministry. My only frustration: it left me wanting more!<br> -- <b>Mark Meynell</b> - Associate Director (Europe), Langham Preaching, Langham Partnership <br><br>I need this book, and I suspect I'm not alone. As a friend and former colleague of Christopher, I have seen first hand his zeal for the Lord. And I have also seen how that can lead to near burnout. Full of biblical and applied wisdom, this book will rescue many a minister and ministry.<br> -- <b>Robin Weekes</b> - Minister, Emmanuel Church Wimbledon <br><br>It's something we all want - zeal without burnout - and here is a book to help us. Christopher explores the dynamic between a life given to Christ and serving Him in a ministry job. The personal stories make it accessible, practical and at times touching. A great read for any team even before you go through busy times.<br> -- <b>Nat Schluter</b> - Principal, Johannesburg Bible College <br><br>In this marvelous and much-needed book, Christopher Ash manages to warn, encourage, expose and comfort in equal measure. Every page is humane, penetrating, rich, wise and above all, gospel-saturated. This book came to me as a word in season from a humble brother (and the other brothers and sisters who shared their stories), and I am sure God will use it to do the same for many, many others. <br> --<b> Gary Millar</b> - Principal, Queensland Theological College, Australia</p><h2>Naruto, Vol. 70 (70)</h2><p>Naruto is a young shinobi with an incorrigible knack for mischief.

Judy was loyal, with a keen sense for who was friend and who was foe, and the pair's relationship deepened throughout their captivity. When the prisoners suffered beatings, Judy would interrupt by barking. She survived bombings and other near-death experiences and became a beacon for the men, who saw in her survival a flicker of hope for their own. <br><br> Judy was WWII's only canine POW, and when she passed away in 1950, she was buried in her Air Force jacket. Williams would never own another dog. Their story--of an unbreakable bond forged in the worst circumstance--is one of the great undiscovered sagas of WWII.</p><p><strong>Robert Weintraub</strong> is a sports columnist for <i>Slate</i>, and his writing has also aired on ESPN, ABC Sports, CBS Sports, and dozens of other outlets.

As Mark searches for a pathway back to his own time on Earth, he must make a new life in a new world. His encounters with primitive tribes bring the joy of human bonds, but violence and war as well--and, finally, a contest in which he discovers his own startling powers.</p></p><p>Gary Paulsen, author of several books of high adventure and survival--including the Newbery Honor winners <i>Dogsong</i>, <i>Hatchet</i>, and <i>The Winter Room</i>--this time brings readers a science fiction tale reminiscent of <i>Planet of the Apes</i>. <i>The Transall Saga</i> follows 13-year-old Mark on his first solo desert camping trip. After stepping into a mysterious beam of light, Mark is transported to another place--a strange and hostile world. As Mark tries to find his way back home, he learns to survive in this dangerous jungle, calling on reserves of strength he didn't know he had. Encountering wild creatures, primitive tribes, and a more advanced and warlike group of humans, the young protagonist is forced to grow up before he can return to the life he once knew. In the process, he becomes a slave, a warrior, and falls in love--all before the mystery of exactly where he is becomes clear. <p> As an adventure story and coming-of-age tale, <i>The Transall Saga</i> makes for gripping reading. While the account of Mark carving a new life in a place both strangely familiar and totally alien is cleverly imagined, the science fiction elements are, unfortunately, not nearly as well thought out. Still, fans of Paulsen's other works will find much to enjoy here, including vivid characters, exotic locations, and feral beasts that will not soon be forgotten.

At nearly every stage of a girl&#x2019;s development something is spurting or sprouting or budding or blossoming. Garden metaphors abound! Based solely on evidence provided by decades of &#x201c;feminine hygiene&#x201d; advertisements, you&#x2019;d be forgiven for concluding that getting your period is basically a monthly frolic through a field of sweet-smelling flowers.&nbsp;</p><p>But have you ever actually spent any time in a garden? It is dirty business. Literally. Plus, there are thorns and worms and, if you know anything about gardening, likely some sort of manure. So while it&#x2019;s not a perfect field of sweet-smelling flowers, a real garden may actually be the perfect metaphor. Puberty is messy business.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, and there will be blood. A lot of it. Think: horror movie. Sometimes it may look and feel like a waterfall of blood when in actual fact you merely overslept and your maxi pad, the one that all the commercials tell you is so good at absorption, was simply not up to the task of your heavy flow day. Some people call those ruined panties &#x201c;period underwear&#x201d; and only pull them out of the drawer each month as needed. We like to think of them as our Red Badges of Courage.</p><p>And while we&#x2019;re on the topic of maxi pads, can we discuss the blue dye that we see in commercials as proof that the pads work? Since you probably haven&#x2019;t gotten your period yet, I want to let you in on a little secret: the blood you&#x2019;ll see when you get your period&#x2014;it&#x2019;s not blue. In fact, sometimes it&#x2019;s not red. It can be all sorts of shades from red to brown. Just being honest here. You&#x2019;ll find that&#x2019;s the tone of this whole book.</p><p>So why does puberty get such a clean rap in all the commercials? Why do we usually talk about what happens to our bodies as though actual<i>information</i> is a tampon we need to quietly slip up our sleeves when we walk across the room? I&#x2019;m not really sure. But what I do know is that it needs to change.</p><p>Girls, bear with me for a moment&#x2014;we need to loop in your grown-ups.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Adults:&nbsp;</b></p><p>The girl sitting next to you is smart. She needs to know what&#x2019;s about to happen. Good thing you bought this book because I can guarantee the information she needs isn&#x2019;t at the bottom of a Yahoo Answers rabbit hole. It&#x2019;s a bit like reading <i>Are You There God? It&#x2019;s Me, Margaret</i> had it been written on the bathroom wall of Penn Station. With a Sharpie. Think that&#x2019;s an exaggeration? Please pause here for a moment and go Google pubic hair.&nbsp;</p><p>See?</p><p>Thanks to the prevalence of unrestricted pornography on the Internet it&#x2019;s nearly impossible to Google anything about female anatomy without being immediately confronted by pornographic images. In fact, some studies suggest that children are encountering online porn as young as eight. <i>Not your children, of course, never your children.</i> But the children they know and talk to and play with. That&#x2019;s because online porn is the contemporary equivalent of your friend&#x2019;s older brother&#x2019;s contraband issue of<i>Playboy</i> that somehow made its way to your sixth-grade sleepover.</p><p>But even without those images there is simply <i>so much</i> information out there. How can a curious young girl, in search of answers about the changes she is experiencing, going to be able to differentiate between what is true and what she finds on the fourth page of a grammar-free message board?</p><p>I believe it&#x2019;s critical for your girl to understand what&#x2019;s happening to her own body. She needs to know that the world may start treating her differently just because she now looks like a woman. She also needs to know the basic essential fact that puberty is connected to reproduction. If she&#x2019;s not armed with this information she will have a much harder time processing the world around her and making good decisions. So take a deep breath and kindly hand the book back to her.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Okay, Girls, back to you.</b></p><p>As founder of HelloFlo.com I&#x2019;ve been in the unique position to hear from thousands of girls and women about how they relate to their own bodies, and I&#x2019;ve come to realize that the way we talk about physical changes is, well, lacking. I&#x2019;m writing this book because you deserve honesty and real information. And you deserve to understand what&#x2019;s going on&#x2014;both in your body and in the world around you.</p><p>That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;ve written this book. To supply you with all the facts, even the messy ones and the ones you may find most embarrassing to talk about. And I&#x2019;m doing this in a way that acknowledges how intelligent and sophisticated you are.</p><p>Underlying everything HelloFlo does had been a determination to talk honestly with young women about what is happening with their bodies. No euphemisms, no avoidance, no blue dye.</p><p>We also celebrate it. Puberty is not a curse. It&#x2019;s confusing, uncomfortable, sometimes painful, but also interesting and ultimately powerful and empowering. It&#x2019;s like if a Girl Punk Band made a musical and your body was the orchestra. All Girl. All Punk. All power. That&#x2019;s what this book is&#x2014;Punk Rock Puberty.</p><p>There will be questions you were afraid to ask and ones you didn&#x2019;t know even existed. There will be answers. There will be jokes. There will be stories. Many true, sometimes mortifying, stories. There will be pictures. There will be drawings. There will be Instagrams. There will be Beyonc�. And most definitely there will be blood.</p><p>As corny as this sounds, it&#x2019;s my dream that every girl enters puberty with enough knowledge of what&#x2019;s going on in her body and mind to keep her confident throughout. I&#x2019;ve spoken to countless doctors, parents, and girls while writing this book, and I&#x2019;ve tried to put everything that&#x2019;s useful in these pages. I&#x2019;m not a doctor, I&#x2019;m not even an expert. What I am is a woman who was once a confused girl who made it her mission to remove some of that confusion for the girls that came after me.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Chapter 1</b></p><p><b>Girl, You&#x2019;ll Be a Woman&nbsp;Soon</b></p><p>How soon is soon?&nbsp;</p><p>One year? Five years? Thirty minutes?&nbsp;</p><p>Let&#x2019;s start with the first question.</p><p>It&#x2019;s pretty much guaranteed that at some point your breasts will develop. Your period will arrive, and your body will start to bleed on a regular basis. (More on the bleeding later. I&#x2019;ll get to that.) It&#x2019;s also a sure thing to say you&#x2019;ll grow hair under your arms, between your legs, and on your legs. And these are just the changes you&#x2019;ll be able to see.</p><p>You may be thinking to yourself, that&#x2019;s a lot of changes. And you may be hoping that I can somehow tell you when to expect that change. I wish I could, but unfortunately I don&#x2019;t have that magical power. What I<i>can</i> tell you is what&#x2019;s behind all those changes and, hopefully, get you a bit more prepared to deal with them, perhaps even embrace them, when they come.</p><p>You are going to hear this a lot throughout this book, but the fact is that everyone&#x2019;s body is different and everyone has her own clock. This is an important thing to remember in life, not just about puberty. The truth is, so much of preparing for womanhood is preparing for things to happen to your body over which you have very little control. I can give you a rough idea of when these changes will start to occur, and in what order they will arrive, but that&#x2019;s about as good as a timetable gets.</p><p>Yes, it&#x2019;s frustrating. Yes, it would be nice if we were all born with a timetable we could look at in advance (Period Arrival time: Dec. 12, 1:15 p.m.), but that&#x2019;s not how things work.</p><p>The trick to dealing with puberty is to not give yourself a timetable. Try hard not to measure yourself by what&#x2019;s going on with your friends. Your friends&#x2019; bodies are their own and have nothing to do with yours. Some may develop earlier than yours, some may develop later. Whatever your timetable, it will be right. Because it&#x2019;s right for you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>But What&#x2019;s&nbsp;Normal?</b></p><p>Puberty can begin anywhere from eight to sixteen years old. That&#x2019;s a big span of time. Yes, the average age for first period is twelve years old, but remember how an average is calculated, it&#x2019;s all the numbers in the range added up and then divided by the actual number of data points. The average of twenty and eighty is fifty. See how that works? Fifty isn&#x2019;t particularly close to either of those numbers. This is important because many girls (and their parents) use that number twelve as some sort of goalpost for determining if they are normal. But you&#x2019;re normal even when you aren&#x2019;t the average.</p><p>If you&#x2019;re still caught up with the question of when, there is one factor that might be helpful. It&#x2019;s really the only one, and it&#x2019;s definitely not perfect. If you have access to them, ask your biological mother or aunts when they started experiencing the different parts of puberty. But even with that information, I&#x2019;m sorry to say it&#x2019;s not a guarantee the same will happen to you. One of the factors for the lack of precision is that the way we are living now is very different from the way your mother and aunts grew up. Not that long ago, puberty would arrive similar to a line of falling dominoes. Your breasts would start developing, you&#x2019;d get hair under your arms, your period would arrive&#x2014;all in the course of a year or two.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, however, doctors are noticing that puberty begins much earlier than it used to and lasts much longer. So you may get breasts but then not get your period for another three years. Scientists aren&#x2019;t sure why this is happening. It may have something to do with all the light we&#x2019;re exposed to&#x2014;think about it. One hundred years ago some people didn&#x2019;t even have electricity let alone an iPhone they took to bed&#x2014;that&#x2019;s interfering with our sleep and growth patterns. It may also have something to do with the food we eat and how it&#x2019;s cultivated. It may even be from the chemicals in the air or water. It may be from all of these factors working together or something I haven&#x2019;t mentioned. There are many theories, but no one has the answer yet.</p><p>The point is, it&#x2019;s harder than ever to predict when puberty will start and how long it will last. While there&#x2019;s never really been such a thing as<i>normal, </i>even the normal ranges we used to refer to no longer apply the way they did.Your body is running a solo show here. All you can do is pay attention, and be prepared.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Rube Goldberg&nbsp;Machine</b></p><p>A&nbsp;Rube Goldberg machine is a great metaphor for hormones&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a complicated piece of machinery that is designed to perform a relatively simple task. The machine works through a series of chain reactions. Chain reactions are what we need to talk about now. I&#x2019;m going to oversimplify here, so bear with me. In your body, the machine that triggers the chain reaction known as puberty is your ovaries. Actually, it really starts with an area of your brain called the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus releases a hormone that causes the pituitary gland to release a hormone that, essentially, wakes up the ovaries. We&#x2019;ll talk about the other function of ovaries later but for now here&#x2019;s what you need to know.</p><p>Until you enter puberty your ovaries are basically like lightbulbs that have been dimmed really, really low: They&#x2019;re there, but they&#x2019;re not doing a whole lot of anything. Then, when you begin puberty, the volume is turned up a little bit and they start to go to work. And by start to work, I mean they produce those hormones. When the ovaries start making estrogen and progesterone, the hormones then travel all over the body and tell different parts of the body to do different things&#x2014;breast development, hair growth, hip widening, and periods. It's one very complicated chain reaction.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>W-O-M-A-N-?</b></p><p>Most of what we&#x2019;ve discussed so far is mechanical. Hormones are released, and a series of chain reactions cause your body to change. It&#x2019;s all pretty simple when you look at it that way. But another way to look at it is that the chain reaction also starts you on the path to -adulthood&#x2014;or rather, womanhood.&nbsp;</p><p>So what does woman really mean? In my opinion this is actually one of the most important psychological aspects of puberty. Everyone starts saying you&#x2019;re a woman. But really, you&#x2019;re still a kid and you should enjoy being a kid.</p><p>What&#x2019;s different is that your body is preparing itself for doing grown-up things&#x2014;like being able to have a baby. &nbsp;</p><p>But that doesn&#x2019;t mean you&#x2019;re <i>ready</i> to have a baby. You may not be ready to have a baby for a long, long, long time. You may never want to have a baby.&nbsp;</p><p>Just remember that the ability to have a baby does not mean you&#x2019;re no longer a kid. It just means that you&#x2019;re a kid whose ovaries have started producing hormones.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>But&nbsp;how will it feel?&nbsp;Can you tell me?</b></p><p>Yes, I can tell you how it&#x2019;s going to feel. Or at least I can give you a good idea of how it will feel. And I will. In each chapter we&#x2019;ll talk about how the changes might affect your day-to-day life, and how to deal with each of these changes so that you feel like you&#x2019;re in control of your own body. The more you know what&#x2019;s going on, and what will go on, the less scary everything will be (this is true in life also). And a lot of these things might not be scary at all! Sure, sometimes some of these changes might feel uncomfortable, but they won&#x2019;t ever keep you from doing the things you want to do. It&#x2019;s just a matter of being prepared.</p><p>And that&#x2019;s what this book is about. It&#x2019;s about explaining to you exactly what is going on in your body, and all the different ways you can take care of it. And like I said earlier, I&#x2019;m going to tell it to you honestly and won&#x2019;t use any euphemisms because nothing about this topic embarrasses me, and it shouldn&#x2019;t embarrass you, either.</p></p><h2>Milk Bar Life: Recipes &amp; Stories: A Cookbook</h2><p><b>Go off the clock with Christina Tosi of Momofuku Milk Bar as she bakes one-bowl treats, grills with skills, and embraces simple, nostalgic&#x2014;and often savory&#x2014;recipes made from supermarket ingredients.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> For anyone addicted to crack pie�, compost cookies�, and cake truffles, here are their savory counterparts&#x2014;such as Kimcheezits with Blue Cheese Dip, Burnt Honey&#x2013;Butter Kale with Sesame Seeds, and Choose Your Own Adventure Chorizo Burgers&#x2014;along with enough make-at-home sweets to satisfy a cookie-a-day habit.

Instead, I dreamed of Cookies, Cookies, Cookies (working name), a bakery of my own that would leave me happily covered in flour and sugar, morning to midnight, and, if I played my cards right, an unconscionable amount of raw cookie dough. Chubby and sporting the finest bowl cut the local cuttery could trim, I would turn cardboard boxes into cash registers and bakery cases, practice making change with Monopoly money (you gotta know how to make the sale!), and concoct gluey batters and sprinkle-ridden doughs to feed to my stuffed animals (they were BIG fans). As I got a little older, my legs grew longer, and my dreams stretched too. I imagined a fun but simple place that brought people happiness and anchored their morning commute or evening stroll, a place where anyone could stop by, say hi, and eat cookies. <br><br> And, by some stroke of insane luck, universes aligning, honest-to-goodness hard work, and practical kitchen experience, that&#x2019;s exactly what happened. I opened Momofuku Milk Bar when I was twenty-seven, nearly six years ago. And in barely enough time to blink (and still not yet enough time to sleep) it has grown from one tiny bakery to a bigger thing than I ever imagined, all anchored by an 11,000-square-foot kitchen that sends cookies around the world and stocks six shops in New York where people stop by, say hi, and eat cookies.<br><br> I can never quite put my finger on exactly how or why it all happened. All I remember is a onetime admission into the school of hard knocks, bakery edition. Dave Chang pushing me out of the nest and more or less tricking me into opening the first Milk Bar was also probably a big help too. <br><br> Funny thing is, when asked just how I got to where I am, I know the answer is pretty simple: I. Have. No. Clue. <br><br> When did it all begin? Shrugging my shoulders, I&#x2019;ll tell you it&#x2019;s always existed&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve always been working up to this moment. My entire life, all I have ever tried to do was to be me and stay me, Cookies, Cookies, Cookies and all.<b><br> </b><br> <b>The Greta (Sugar Cookie Squares)</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Makes about 2 Dozen 2-inch Squares<br> &nbsp;<br> I was raised on these sugar cookie squares. My fondest memories of them involve receiving disposable 9 � 13-inch pans of them once a week (that&#x2019;s 3.43 cookies a day) when I was away at college (and I didn&#x2019;t have a kitchen of my own to bake in). What a mom!<br> &nbsp;<br> Even after I opened Milk Bar, my mom still sent me these sugar cookie squares, direct to the bakery. They became so legendary we called them &#x201c;Greta cookies&#x201d; or &#x201c;the Greta,&#x201d; because you can&#x2019;t call a sugar cookie a sugar cookie in a bakery; it&#x2019;s just too confusing. Also, the difference between a sugar cookie and a Greta sugar cookie square is huge.<br> &nbsp;<br> Their flavor is simple, but just as you think you&#x2019;re about to be underwhelmed, wham!

A church building was used as officers&#x2019; lodgings by the British authorities governing Palestine, and Shomron was waiting for one of those officers, a man named Tom Wilkin, to leave.<br><br>Wilkin was the commander of the Jewish unit at the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the British Mandate for Palestine, and he was very good at his job, especially the part that involved infiltrating and disrupting the fractious Jewish underground. Aggressive, yet also exceptionally patient and calculating, Wilkin spoke fluent Hebrew, and after thirteen years of service in Palestine, he had an extensive network of informants. Thanks to the intelligence they provided, underground fighters were arrested, their weapons caches were seized, and their planned operations, aimed at forcing the British to leave Palestine, were foiled.<br><br>Which was why Shomron was going to kill him.<br><br>Shomron and his partner that night, Yaakov Banai (code-named Mazal&#x2014;&#x201c;Luck&#x201d;), were operatives with Lehi, the most radical of the Zionist underground movements fighting the British in the early 1940s. Though Lehi was the acronym for the Hebrew phrase &#x201c;fighters for the freedom of Israel,&#x201d; the British considered it a terrorist organization, referring to it dismissively as the Stern Gang, after its founder, the romantic ultra-nationalist Avraham Stern. Stern and his tiny band of followers employed a targeted mayhem of assassinations and bombings&#x2014;a campaign of &#x201c;personal terror,&#x201d; as Lehi&#x2019;s operations chief (and later Israeli prime minister), Yitzhak Shamir, called it.<br><br>Wilkin knew he was a target. Lehi already had tried to kill him and his boss, Geoffrey Morton, nearly three years earlier, in its first, clumsy operation. On January 20, 1942, assassins planted bombs on the roof and inside the building of 8 Yael Street, in Tel Aviv. Instead they ended up killing three police officers&#x2014;two Jews and an Englishman&#x2014;who arrived before Wilkin and Morton and tripped the charges. Later, Morton fled Palestine after being wounded in another attempt on his life&#x2014;that one in retribution for Morton having shot Stern dead.<br><br>None of those details, the back-and-forth of who killed whom and in what order, mattered to Shomron. The British occupied the land the Zionists saw as rightfully theirs&#x2014;that was what mattered, and Shamir had issued a death sentence against Wilkin.<br><br>For Shomron and his comrades, Wilkin was not a person but rather a target, prominent and high-value. &#x201c;We were too busy and hungry to think about the British and their families,&#x201d; Shomron said decades later.<br><br>After discovering that Wilkin was residing in the Romanian Church annex, the assassins set out on their mission. Shomron and Banai had revolvers and hand grenades in their pockets. Additional Lehi operatives were in the vicinity, smartly dressed in suits and hats to look like Englishmen.<br><br>Wilkin left the officers&#x2019; lodgings in the church and headed for the CID&#x2019;s facility in the Russian Compound, where underground suspects were held and interrogated. As always, he was wary, scanning the street as he walked and keeping one hand in his pocket all the time. As he passed the corner of St. George and Mea Shearim Streets, a youngster sitting outside the neighborhood grocery store got up and dropped his hat. This was the signal, and the two assassins began walking toward Wilkin, identifying him according to the photographs they&#x2019;d studied. Shomron and Banai let him pass, gripping their revolvers with sweating palms.<br><br>Then they turned around and drew.<br><br>&#x201c;Before we did it, Mazal [Banai] said, &#x2018;Let me shoot first,&#x2019; &#x201d; Shomron recalled. &#x201c;But when we saw him, I guess I couldn&#x2019;t restrain myself. I shot first.&#x201d;<br><br>Between them, Banai and Shomron fired fourteen times. Eleven of those bullets hit Wilkin. &#x201c;He managed to turn around and draw his pistol,&#x201d; Shomron said, &#x201c;but then he fell face first. A spurt of blood came out of his forehead, like a fountain. It was not such a pretty picture.&#x201d;<br><br>Shomron and Banai darted back into the shadows and made off in a taxi in which another Lehi man was waiting for them.<br><br>&#x201c;The only thing that hurt me was that we forgot to take the briefcase in which he had all his documents,&#x201d; Shomron said. Other than that, &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t feel anything, not even a little twinge of guilt. We believed the more coffins that reached London, the closer the day of freedom would be.&#x201d;<br><br>The idea that the return of the People of Israel to the Land of Israel could be achieved only by force was not born with Stern and his Lehi comrades.<br><br>The roots of that strategy can be traced to eight men who gathered in a stifling one-room apartment overlooking an orange grove in Jaffa on September 29, 1907, exactly thirty-seven years before a fountain of blood spurted from Wilkin&#x2019;s head, when Palestine was still part of the Turkish Ottoman Empire. The flat was rented by Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, a young Russian who&#x2019;d immigrated to Ottoman Palestine earlier that year. Like the others in his apartment that night&#x2014;all emigrants from the Russian empire, sitting on a straw mat spread on the floor of the candlelit room&#x2014;he was a committed Zionist, albeit part of a splinter sect that had once threatened to rend the movement.<br><br>Zionism as a political ideology had been founded in 1896 when Viennese Jewish journalist Theodor Herzl published Der Judenstaat (The Jewish State). He had been deeply affected while covering the trial in Paris of Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish army officer unjustly accused and convicted of treason.<br><br>In his book, Herzl argued that anti-Semitism was so deeply ingrained in European culture that the Jewish people could achieve true freedom and safety only in a nation-state of their own. The Jewish elite of Western Europe, who&#x2019;d managed to carve out comfortable lives for themselves, mostly rejected Herzl. But his ideas resonated with poor and working-class Jews of Eastern Europe, who suffered repeated pogroms and continual oppression and to which some of them responded by aligning themselves with leftist uprisings.<br><br>Herzl himself saw Palestine, the Jews&#x2019; ancestral homeland, as the ideal location for a future Jewish state, but he maintained that any settlement there would have to be handled deliberately and delicately, through proper diplomatic channels and with international sanction, if a Jewish nation was to survive in peace. Herzl&#x2019;s view came to be known as political Zionism.<br><br>Ben-Zvi and his seven comrades, on the other hand, were&#x2014;like most other Russian Jews&#x2014;practical Zionists. Rather than wait for the rest of the world to give them a home, they believed in creating one themselves&#x2014;in going to Palestine, working the land, making the desert bloom. They would take what they believed to be rightfully theirs, and they would defend what they had taken.<br><br>This put the practical Zionists in immediate conflict with most of the Jews already living in Palestine. As a tiny minority in an Arab land&#x2014;many of them peddlers and religious scholars and functionaries under the Ottoman regime&#x2014;they preferred to keep a low profile. Through subservience and compromise and bribery, these established Palestinian Jews had managed to buy themselves relative peace and a measure of security.<br><br>But Ben-Zvi and the other newcomers were appalled at the conditions their fellow Jews tolerated. Many were living in abject poverty and had no means of defending themselves, utterly at the mercy of the Arab majority and the venal officials of the corrupt Ottoman Empire. Arab mobs attacked and plundered Jewish settlements, rarely with any consequences. Worse, as Ben-Zvi and the others saw it, those same settlements had consigned their defense to Arab guards&#x2014;who in turn would sometimes collaborate with attacking mobs.<br><br>Ben-Zvi and his friends found this situation to be unsustainable and intolerable. Some were former members of Russian left-wing revolutionary movements inspired by the People&#x2019;s Will (Narodnaya Volya), an aggressive anti-tsarist guerrilla movement that employed terrorist tactics, including assassinations.<br><br>Disappointed by the abortive 1905 revolution in Russia, which in the end produced only minimal constitutional reforms, some of these socialist revolutionaries, social democrats, and liberals moved to Ottoman Palestine to reestablish a Jewish state.<br><br>They all were desperately poor, barely scraping by, earning pennies at teaching jobs or manual labor in the fields and orange groves, often going hungry. But they were proud Zionists. If they were going to create a nation, they first had to defend themselves. So they slipped through the streets of Jaffa in pairs and alone, making their way to the secret meeting in Ben-Zvi&#x2019;s apartment. That night, those eight people formed the first Hebrew fighting force of the modern age. They decreed that, from then forward, everything would be different from the image of the weak and persecuted Jew all across the globe. Only Jews would defend Jews in Palestine.<br><br>They named their fledgling army Bar-Giora, after one of the leaders of the Great Jewish Revolt against the Roman Empire, in the first century. On their banner, they paid homage to that ancient rebellion and predicted their future. &#x201c;In blood and fire Judea fell,&#x201d; it read. &#x201c;In blood and fire Judea will rise.&#x201d;<br><br>Judea would indeed rise. Ben-Zvi would one day be the Jewish nation&#x2019;s second president. Yet first there would be much fire, and much blood.<br><br>Bar-Giora was not, at first, a popular movement. But more Jews arrived in Palestine from Russia and Eastern Europe every year&#x2014;35,000 between 1905 and 1914&#x2014;bringing with them that same determined philosophy of practical Zionism.<br><br>With more like-minded Jews flooding into the Yishuv, as the Jewish community in Palestine was called, Bar-Giora in 1909 was reconstituted into the larger and more aggressive Hashomer (Hebrew for &#x201c;the Guard&#x201d;). By 1912, Hashomer was defending fourteen settlements. Yet it was also developing offensive, albeit clandestine, capabilities, preparing for what practical Zionists saw as an inevitable eventual war to take control of Palestine. Hashomer therefore saw itself as the nucleus for a future Jewish army and intelligence service.<br><br>Mounted on their horses, Hashomer vigilantes raided a few Arab settlements to punish residents who had harmed Jews, sometimes beating them up, sometimes executing them. In one case, a special clandestine assembly of Hashomer members decided to eliminate a Bedouin policeman, Aref al-Arsan, who had assisted the Turks and tortured Jewish prisoners. He was shot dead by Hashomer in June 1916.<br><br>Hashomer did not recoil from using force to assert its authority over other Jews, either. During World War I, Hashomer was violently opposed to NILI, a Jewish spy network working for the British in Ottoman Palestine. Hashomer feared that the Turks would discover the spies and wreak vengeance against the entire Jewish community. When they failed to get NILI to cease operations or to hand over a stash of gold coins they&#x2019;d received from the British, they made an attempt on the life of Yosef Lishansky, one of its members, managing only to wound him.<br><br>In 1920, Hashomer evolved again, now into the Haganah (Hebrew for &#x201c;Defense&#x201d;). Though it was not specifically legal, the British authorities, who had been ruling the country for about three years, tolerated the Haganah as the paramilitary defensive arm of the Yishuv. The Histadrut, the socialist labor union of the Jews in Israel that was founded in the same year, and the Jewish Agency, the Yishuv&#x2019;s autonomous governing authority, established a few years later, both headed by David Ben-Gurion, maintained command over the secret organization.<br><br>Ben-Gurion was born David Yosef Gr�n in P&#x142;o�nsk, Poland, in 1886. From an early age, he followed in his father&#x2019;s footsteps as a Zionist activist. In 1906, he migrated to Palestine and, thanks to his charisma and determination, soon became one of the leaders of the Yishuv, despite his youth. He then changed his name to Ben-Gurion, after another of the leaders of the revolt against the Romans.<br><br>Haganah in its early years was influenced by the spirit and aggressive attitude of Hashomer. On May 1, 1921, an Arab mob massacred fourteen Jews in an immigrants&#x2019; hostel in Jaffa. After learning that an Arab police officer by the name of Tewfik Bey had helped the mob get into the hostel, Haganah sent a hit squad to dispose of him, and on January 17, 1923, he was shot dead in the middle of a Tel Aviv street. &#x201c;As a matter of honor,&#x201d; he was shot from the front and not in the back, according to one of those involved, and the intention was &#x201c;to show the Arabs that their deeds are not forgotten and their day will come, even if belatedly.&#x201d;<br><br>The members of Hashomer who led the Haganah at the outset were even willing to commit acts of violence against fellow Jews. Jacob de Haan was a Dutch-born Haredi&#x2014;an ultra-Orthodox Jew&#x2014;living in Jerusalem in the early 1920s. He was a propagandist for the Haredi belief that only the Messiah could establish a Jewish state, that God alone would decide when to return the Jews to their ancestral homeland, and that humans trying to expedite the process were committing a grave sin. In other words, de Haan was a staunch anti-Zionist, and he was surprisingly adept at swaying international opinion. To Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, by now a prominent Haganah leader, that made de Haan dangerous. So he ordered his death.<br><br>On June 30, 1924&#x2014;just a day before de Haan was to travel to London to ask the British government to reconsider its promise to establish a Jewish nation in Palestine&#x2014;two assassins shot him three times as he emerged from a synagogue on Jaffa Road in Jerusalem.<br><br>Ben-Gurion, however, took a dim view of such acts. He realized that in order to win even partial recognition from the British for Zionist aims, he would have to enforce orderly and more moderate norms on the semi-underground militia under his command. Hashomer&#x2019;s brave and lethal lone riders were replaced after the de Haan murder by an organized, hierarchical armed force. Ben-Gurion ordered Haganah to desist from using targeted killings. &#x201c;As to personal terror, Ben-Gurion&#x2019;s line was consistently and steadily against it,&#x201d; Haganah commander Yisrael Galili testified later, and he recounted a number of instances in which Ben-Gurion had refused to approve proposals for hits against individual Arabs. These included the Palestinian leader Hajj Amin al-Husseini and other members of the Arab Higher Committee, and British personnel, such as a senior official in the Mandate&#x2019;s lands authority who was obstructing Jewish settlement projects.<br><br>Not everyone was eager to acquiesce to Ben-Gurion. Avraham Tehomi, the man who shot de Haan, despised the moderate line Ben-Gurion took against the British and the Arabs, and, together with some other leading figures, he quit Haganah and in 1931 formed the Irgun Zvai Leumi, the &#x201c;National Military Organization&#x201d; whose Hebrew acronym is Etzel, usually referred to in English as IZL or the Irgun. This radical right-wing group was commanded in the 1940s by Menachem Begin, who in 1977 was to become prime minister of Israel. Inside the Irgun, too, there were clashes, personal and ideological. Opponents of Begin&#x2019;s agreement to cooperate with Britain in its war against the Nazis broke away and formed Lehi. For these men, any cooperation with Britain was anathema.</p><h2>So I&#39;m a Spider, So What?, Vol. 5 (light novel) (So I&#39;m a Spider, So What?

You have to be the most athletic, you have to be able to have the most fun, you have to be the prettiest, the best dressed, the nicest, the most wanted. You have to constantly be out on the town partying, and then you have to get straight As. And most of all, you have to appear to be happy." -- CJ, age seventeen<br><br> High school isn't what it used to be. With record numbers of students competing fiercely to get into college, schools are no longer primarily places of learning. They're dog-eat-dog battlegrounds in which kids must set aside interests and passions in order to strategize over how to game the system. In this increasingly stressful environment, kids aren't defined by their character or hunger for knowledge, but by often arbitrary scores and statistics.<br><br> In <em>The Overachievers</em>, journalist Alexandra Robbins delivers a poignant, funny, riveting narrative that explores how our high-stakes educational culture has spiraled out of control. During the year of her ten-year reunion, Robbins returns to her high school, where she follows students, including CJ and others:<br><br> <ul> <li>Julie, a track and academic star who is terrified she's making the wrong choices;</li> <li>"AP" Frank, who grapples with horrifying parental pressure to succeed;</li> <li>Taylor, a soccer and lacrosse captain whose ambition threatens her popular girl status;</li> <li>Sam, who worries his years of overachieving will be wasted if he doesn't attend a name-brand college;</li> <li>Audrey, who struggles with perfectionism; and</li> <li>The Stealth Overachiever, a mystery junior who flies under the radar.</li></ul> Robbins tackles hard-hitting issues such as the student and teacher cheating epidemic, over-testing, sports rage, the black market for study drugs, and a college admissions process so cutthroat that some students are driven to depression and suicide because of a B. Even the earliest years of schooling have become insanely competitive, as Robbins learned when she gained unprecedented access into the inner workings of a prestigious Manhattan kindergarten admissions office. A compelling mix of fast-paced storytelling and engrossing investigative journalism, <em>The Overachievers</em> aims both to calm the admissions frenzy and to expose its escalating dangers.</p><p><strong>Alexandra Robbins</strong> is a former staff member of <em>The New Yorker</em> and the author of two <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers. Her work has appeared in publications including <em>The New Yorker, The Atlantic Monthly, Washington Post, USA Today, Cosmopolitan, Mademoiselle, Chicago Tribune, Self, Washington Monthly, Time Digital, Salon, Details, Shape, PC, Tennis Week,</em> and the <em>Journal of Popular Culture</em>. She graduated summa cum laude in 1998 from Yale.At a time when "underperforming" seems to be the sorry watchword of American education, it's unsettling to come across a book bemoaning the plight of the overachievers. Forget the impoverished teenagers stuck in anarchic schools that would shame the worst Third World potentate; it's the kids with a shot at Harvard who've really got problems. They have too much homework in too many classes, extracurriculars that require their leadership and parents who feel entitled to a sticker from a name-brand college on their car. And then there are SAT prep classes to attend, recruitment calls from Ivy League coaches to field and prom to dread.<p>At least, that's how Alexandra Robbins reports it in her latest book, The Overachievers. She spent three semesters in 2004 and 2005 at Walt Whitman High School in Bethesda, her alma mater and one of the top public high schools in the country, to gather evidence for her sweeping indictment of the "twisted values of an educational system gone wrong." While Whitman hardly seems like an appropriate first stop on a tour of educational dysfunction (its average SAT scores are more than 200 points above the national average, and 95 percent of its students go on to college), Robbins found ample evidence that its top students are overwhelmed by all that they have to do.</p><p>She follows eight students (four juniors, three seniors and one college freshman) who are all struggling to cope: Julie's hair is falling out; Ryland has panic attacks before physics tests; Audrey is so afraid of falling behind that she goes to school even when she's terribly sick. (Most of the names were changed.) And what's it all for? Admission to a top-ranked college. "As Sam explained to me in only our second meeting," writes Robbins, "if he didn't get into a school whose prestige reflected his exhaustive work and the nights he spent studying until three A.M., he would feel he had 'done a lot for naught,' even if he fell in love with a non-elite school that was perfect for him." </p><p>Robbins's strength is in the particular, in spending hours and hours with her subjects, earning their trust and serving as the scribe to their anxieties. Her description of Julie's elation at beating her own best track time is thrilling, while Frank's frustrated rage at his mother's dictatorial control ("You want [to] spend time with friends?" she screams on one occasion. "You are a social whore!") is heartbreaking. The agonizing over romances gone awry and test scores that don't measure up reads truer than any yearbook ever could.</p><p>But Robbins, whose previous books investigated sorority life and the Yale secret society Skull and Bones, stumbles when she widens her lens to what she says is a nationwide crisis of "overachieverism," in which high school has become "a competitive frenzy . . . a hotbed for Machiavellian strategy." While that is undoubtedly true for a subset of students from a subset of high schools gunning for a subset of very exclusive colleges, most students graduate blissfully unscathed. (Teachers and parents in schools across the land, not to mention Education Secretary Margaret Spellings and her No Child Left Behind acolytes, beg for such a plague of competitive frenzy.) Indeed, according to the Department of Education, the vast majority of students attend colleges that accept more than half of those applying -- and don't particularly care what club an applicant presided over as a high school sophomore.</p><p>In a clumsy attempt to document the universality of this overachievement crisis, Robbins subjects readers to blasts of facts on sleep deprivation, suicide, eating disorders, cheating, college admissions and Asian educational systems. She interviews students from New Mexico to Nebraska to the famously competitive New Trier High School outside Chicago. But throughout it all, she skates past how issues of wealth and privilege (and their opposites) play into her thesis. That becomes most obvious when she takes a lengthy and puzzling detour through the admissions process at elite Manhattan preschools. Yes, it's bizarre that the schools observe toddlers at play to decide which ones will make the cut, but she never makes the case that what goes on in these rarefied schools is relevant to anyone but the very rich.</p><p>And yet she has prescriptions for everyone: Colleges should dump the SAT and boycott U.S. News's college rankings (I once served as deputy editor for education at U.S. News but did not work on the rankings, thankfully); high schools should stop ranking students, limit the number of Advanced Placement classes students can take and allow them to get healthy amounts of sleep by delaying start times; parents should "get a life," and students should "accept that admissions aren't personal." </p><p>But in an age of rampant grade inflation, college admissions officers use class rankings and standardized test scores to determine whether there's a brain behind all those A-filled report cards. And few students really need to cut back on AP classes. The average qualified high schooler takes just one a year.</p><p> The Overachievers hardly inspires hand-wringing about the state of American education. In fact, this reader came away thinking that even these stressed kids would be all right. Not all of them got into Ivy League schools, and not all of them will have the world-changing careers that they imagine for themselves. (But really, who does?) Even the unhappy ones -- Ryland and Frank with their cruel mothers, Audrey with her crippling perfectionism -- had slowly begun to feel their way toward saner ground by the end of the school year. These kids -- these bright, hard-working, overachieving kids, these kids who should make every parent and teacher glow with pride -- will be just fine.</p><p>Reviewed by Rachel Hartigan Shea <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

Following the traditional framework of an anatomy book that explains each body system chapter-by-chapter, Pip Waller&#x2014;an experienced practitioner and teacher&#x2014;provides fundamental information and tips about exercise, diet, supplements, understanding and caring for your emotional and mental health, naturopathic principles from various traditions, and simple yet effective ways of working with spiritual energy. Based on the premise that an underlying vital force&#x2014;which needs to be in balance for health to be fully present&#x2014;animates all life, this book is designed to support and promote our inherent tendency toward wholeness and equilibrium. Each chapter includes fun recipes to enhance health and well-being.</p><p>Pip Waller is an experienced medical herbalist and plant spirit medicine healer, writer and teacher. She lives in North Wales UK, in a small town on a beautiful river, surrounded by magical hills.

When Dutch monarch William of Orange ascended to the English throne in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, burning questions over the best form of governance for England were prominent in the intelligentsia of the era. It was a time when England grappled with its incremental transition from monarchy to early forms of democracy and right to vote, where dynastic monarchy and religious theory still held considerable power over the formation of the state. <br><br> In the first treatise Locke proceeds to attack and dissect his prominent contemporary Robert Filmer, who was broadly in favour of absolute monarchy under the principle of divine right. The allusions to the Biblical Adam, wherein the monarch can be intimated as a continuation of the first man ever created, are debunked by Locke who asserts that God never asserted that one man had province to rule over all other human beings. Supporting his argument with known history, Locke concludes that no king over the centuries had asserted to be the heir of Adam and thereby the rightful ruler of a country. <br><br> In the second treatise Locke turns to a different topic - that of the state of nature. He discusses how humanity may have behaved prior to the establishment of formal societies, and concludes that humanity - even without an established government in place - had never been truly lawless even when freedom was at its farthest extent. In arguing against the tyranny of absolute monarchy, while acknowledging the advantages of humanity's freedom in its natural ungoverned state, Locke arrives at his conclusion: a democratically elected government, whereby humans are accorded freedoms but must conform to the rule of law, is the most advantageous type of government to which humans can aspire. <br><br> Lauded as a classic of political philosophy, the treatises by Locke are a common requirement in various educational courses concerning political science and philosophy to this day. While steeped in the historical realities of the late 17th century, the arguments Locke composes for governance favourable to the people and their country's development were immensely influential on political theory during and after the Enlightenment era.</p><p>About The Author John Locke (1632&#x2014;1704) was one of the most influential philosophers and political theorists of the 17th century. In the area of politics, Locke is recognised as a proponent of limited government. His theory of natural rights argues that governments have obligations to citizens and can ultimately be overthrown by citizens under certain circumstances. He also argues powerfully in favor of religious toleration. He is at times regarded as the founder of the British Empiricism school of thought, and he contributed to modern theories of limited, liberal government. In the Essay Concerning Human Understanding, Locke provides an analysis of the human mind and its acquisition of knowledge. His empiricist theory is that we acquire ideas through our experience of the world and we examine and combine our ideas in different ways. Knowledge consists of a special kind of relationship between different ideas.</p><h2>Soul Comfort for Cat Lovers: Coping Wisdom for Heart and Soul After the Loss of a Beloved Feline</h2><p><em>"...more than just another book on pet loss.

Find her online at http://lynnekellybooks.com/wordpress and on Twitter at @LynneKelly.Until last summer I thought the only thing I had in common with that whale on the beach was a name.<br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I sat with Grandpa after collecting shells and driftwood scattered along the shore, and wildflowers from the dunes. The shells and driftwood were for Grandma, and the flowers were for the whale. Grandpa had asked how school was going, and I told him it was the same, which wasn&#x2019;t good. I&#x2019;d been at that school for two years and still felt like the new kid.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Grandpa patted the sand next to him. &#x201c;Did you know she was probably deaf too?&#x201d; he signed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t have to ask who he meant. The whale had been buried there for eleven years, and my parents had told me enough times about what happened that day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I shook my head. I hadn&#x2019;t known that, and I didn&#x2019;t know why Grandpa was changing the subject. Maybe he didn&#x2019;t know what to tell me anymore about school.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The whale had beached herself the same day I was born. When she was spotted in the shallow waters of the Gulf, some people stood on the shore and watched her approach. My grandma ran into the cold February water and tried to push her away from land, as if she could make a forty-ton animal change her mind about where she wanted to go. That was really dangerous. Even though the whale was weak by then, one good whack with a tail or flipper could have knocked Grandma out. I don&#x2019;t know what I would&#x2019;ve done--jumped in like she did or just stood there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;She wasn&#x2019;t born deaf like we were,&#x201d; Grandpa continued. &#x201c;The scientists who studied her said it had just happened. Maybe she&#x2019;d been swimming near an explosion from an oil rig or a bomb test.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Grandpa told a story, I saw it as clearly as if it were happening right there in front of me. His signing hands showed me the whale in an ocean that suddenly went quiet, swimming over there, over there, over there, trying to find the sounds again. Maybe that was why she&#x2019;d been there on our Gulf of Mexico beach instead of in deep ocean waters where she belonged. Sei whales didn&#x2019;t swim so close to shore. Only her, on that day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;A whale can&#x2019;t find its way through a world without sound,&#x201d; Grandpa added. &#x201c;The ocean is dark, and it covers most of the earth, and whales live in all of it. The sounds guide them through that, and they talk to one another across oceans.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With the familiar sounds of the ocean gone, the whale was lost in her new silent world. A rescue group came to the beach and tried to save the whale, and they called her Iris. Grandma asked my parents to give the name to me, too, since I&#x2019;d entered the world as the whale was leaving it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After the marine biologists learned all they could from her, she was buried right there on the beach, along with the unanswered questions about what had brought her to that shore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We lived on that coast until the summer after second grade, when my family moved to Houston for my dad&#x2019;s new job. Since then, we went back just once or twice a summer. The good thing about our new home was that it was closer to my grandparents. I liked being able to spend more time with them, especially since they were both Deaf like me. But we all missed the beach, and I missed being around kids like me. My old school had just a few Deaf kids, but that was enough. We had our classes together, and we had one another.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s different for us,&#x201d; Grandpa signed. &#x201c;Out here, there&#x2019;s more light, and all we need is our own small space to feel at home. Sometimes it takes time to figure things out. But you&#x2019;ll do it. You&#x2019;ll find your way.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I wish I&#x2019;d asked him then how long that would take.</p></p><h2>Regarding the Fountain (Regarding The. . ., 1)</h2><p><p>The Dry Creek Middle School drinking fountain has sprung a leak, so principal Walter Russ dashes off a request to Flowing Waters Fountains, Etc.</p><p>...We need a new drinking fountain. Please send a catalog.</p><p>Designer Flo Waters responds:</p><p>"I'd be delighted...but please understand that all of my fountains are custom-made."</p><p>Soon the fountain project takes on a life of its own, one chronicled in letters, postcards, memos, transcripts, and official documents. The school board president is up in arms. So is Dee Eel, of the water-supply company. A scandal is brewing, and Mr. Sam N.'s fifth grade class is turning up a host of hilarious secrets buried deep beneath the fountain.</p></p><p>How could a simple request for a new water fountain go so very, very off-track? When Principal Wally Russ writes to fountain designer Florence Waters to ask her to replace Dry Creek Middle School's busted drinking fountain, he little suspects that he is sparking the imagination of an <i>artiste</i>. Kate Klise's charming mystery novel is told entirely in letters and faxes, as the glamorous Florence visits Dry Creek and becomes friends with Mr. Sam N.'s fifth-grade class. The class helps Florence design the most outrageous water fountain ever, and along the way uncovers the dirty (and rather wet) secret that dwells underneath Dry Creek Middle School. Writes Florence to her new fifth-grade friends, "Your drawings are hanging in my studio. Pure inspiration. Of course a drinking fountain should have tropical fish and chocolate shakes!" The book reads like an inspired combination of the epistolary novels <i>Daddy-Long-Legs</i> and <i>Griffin &amp; Sabine</i>. Line drawings by M. Sarah Klise adorn every page, with "snapshots" of the fifth-grade class, pages from the local paper, and coffee-stained While You Were Out notices thickening the stew. The emphasis on visual elements should make the book a hit with kids who claim they don't like to read. Author Klise knows her audience: bad puns flow as freely as water and the plot is just convoluted enough to challenge kids without frustrating them. The Klise sisters have created a classic of comic children's literature.

He earned his B.A. in anthropology from Mississippi State University and a master's degree from the University of Georgia, where he did course work for a Ph.D. He lives in Savannah, GA, where, in addition to full-time writing, he enjoys cooking, fencing, the company of his family and friends and lazy Savannah nights.

His tone was thoughtful, his saurian features composed in the faint light bleeding down through the cracked slate roof.<br><br>&#x201c;Not so much kill you as get you killed,&#x201d; she answered, pushing the tight rings of her hair off her face and pressing her slightly aquiline nose and gray-green gaze toward the vast open space beneath them.<br><br>&#x201c;It works out the same,&#x201d; the other hissed.<br><br>&#x201c;Come on, Glim,&#x201d; Anna�g said, tossing herself into her father&#x2019;s huge leather chair and clasping her hands behind her neck. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t pass this up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I think it can be safely said that we can,&#x201d; Mere-Glim replied. He lounged on a low weavecane couch, one arm draped so as to suspend over a cypress end table whose surface was supported by the figure of a crouching Khajiit warrior. The Argonian was all silhouette, because behind him the white curtains that draped the massive bay windows of the study were soaked in sunlight.<br><br>&#x201c;Here are some things we could do instead.&#x201d; He ticked one glossy black claw on the table.<br><br>&#x201c;Stay here in your father&#x2019;s villa and drink his wine.&#x201d; A second claw came down. &#x201c;Take some of your father&#x2019;s wine down to the docks and drink it there.&#x201d; The third. &#x201c;Drink some here and some down at the docks . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Glim, how long has it been since we had an adventure?&#x201d;<br><br>His lazy lizard gaze traveled over her face.<br><br>&#x201c;If by adventure you mean some tiring or dangerous exercise, not that long. Not long enough anyway.&#x201d; He wiggled the fingers of both hands as if trying to shake something sticky off them, a peculiarly Lilmothian expression of agitation. The membranes between his digits shone translucent green. &#x201c;Have you been reading again?&#x201d;<br><br>He made it sound like an accusation, as if &#x201c;reading&#x201d; was another way of referring to, say, infanticide.<br><br>&#x201c;A bit,&#x201d; she admitted. &#x201c;What else am I to do? It&#x2019;s so boring here.

That&#x2019;s a bold assertion,&#x201d; he sniffed.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a bold girl.&#x201d; She sat forward. &#x201c;Come on, Glim. He&#x2019;s a were- crocodile. I&#x2019;m certain of it. And we can get the proof.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;First of all,&#x201d; Mere-Glim said, &#x201c;there&#x2019;s no such thing as a were- crocodile. Second, if there were, why on earth would we care to prove it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because . . . well, because people would want to know. We&#x2019;d be famous. And he&#x2019;s dangerous. People around there are always disappearing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In Pusbottom? Of course they are. It&#x2019;s one of the dodgiest parts of town.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve found people bitten in half. What else could do that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A regular crocodile. Lots of things, really. With some effort, I might be able to do it, too.&#x201d; He fidgeted again. &#x201c;Look, if you&#x2019;re so sure about this, get your father to talk Underwarden Ethten into sending some guards down there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, what if I&#x2019;m wrong? Father would look stupid. That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m saying, Glim. I need to know for sure. I must find some sort of proof. I&#x2019;ve been following him&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve what?&#x201d; He gaped his mouth in incredulity.<br><br>&#x201c;He looks human, Glim, but he comes and goes out of the canal like an Argonian. That&#x2019;s how I noticed him. And when I looked where he came out &#x2014;I&#x2019;m sure the first few steps were made by a crocodile, and after that by a man.&#x201d;<br><br>Glim closed his mouth and shook his head.<br><br>&#x201c;Or a man stepped in some crocodile tracks,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;There are potions and amulets that let even you gaspers breathe underwater.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But he does it all the time. Why would he do that? Help me be sure, Glim.&#x201d;<br><br>Her friend sibilated a long hiss. &#x201c;Then can we drink your father&#x2019;s wine?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If he hasn&#x2019;t drunk it all.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fine.&#x201d;<br><br>She clapped her hands in delight. &#x201c;Excellent! I know his routine. He won&#x2019;t be back in his lair until nightfall, so we should go now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Lair?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure. That&#x2019;s what it would be, wouldn&#x2019;t it? A lair.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fine, a lair. Lead on.&#x201d;<br>And now here we are, Anna�g thought.<br><br>They had made their way from the hills of the old Imperial quarter into the ancient, gangrenous heart of Lilmoth&#x2014;Pusbottom. Imperials had dwelt here, too, in the early days when the Empire had first imposed its will and architecture on the lizard people of Black Marsh. Now only the desperate and sinister dwelt here, where patrols rarely came: the poorest of the poor, political enemies of the Argonian An-Xileel party that now dominated the city, criminals and monsters.<br><br>They found the lair easily enough, which turned out to be a livable corner of a manse so ancient the first floor was entirely silted up. What remained was vastly cavernous and rickety and not that unusual in this part of town. What was odd was that it wasn&#x2019;t full of squatters&#x2014; there was just the one. He had furnished the place with mostly junk, but there were a few nice chairs and a decent bed.<br><br>That&#x2019;s about all they got to see before they heard the voices, coming in the same way they had&#x2014;which was to say the only way. Anna�g and Glim were backed up in the corner, and here the walls were stone. The only way to go was up an old staircase and then even farther, using the ancient frame of the house as a ladder. Anna�g wondered what sort of wood&#x2014;if wood it was&#x2014;could resist decomposition for so long. The wall- and floorboards here had been made of something else, and were almost like paper.<br><br>So they had to take care to stay on the beams.<br><br>Glim hushed himself; the figures in the group below were gazing up&#x2014;not at them, but in their vague direction.<br><br>Anna�g took a small vial from the left pocket of her double-breasted jacket and drank its contents. It tasted a bit like melon, but very bitter.<br><br>She felt her lungs fill and empty, the elastic pull of her body around her bones. Her heart seemed to be vibrating instead of beating, and the oddest thing was, she couldn&#x2019;t tell if this was fear.<br><br>The faint noises below suddenly became much louder, as if she was standing among them.<br><br>&#x201c;Where is he?&#x201d; one of the figures asked. They were hard to make out in the dim light, but this one looked darker than the rest, possibly a Dunmer.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be here,&#x201d; another said. He&#x2014;or maybe she&#x2014;was obviously a Khajiit&#x2014; everything about the way he moved was feline.<br><br>&#x201c;He will,&#x201d; a third voice said. Anna�g watched as the man she had been following for the last few days approached the others. Like them, he was too far away to see, but she knew him by the hump of his back, and her memory filled in the details of his brutish face and long, unkempt hair.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you have it?&#x201d; the Khajiit asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Just brought it in under the river.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Seems like a lot of trouble,&#x201d; the Khajiit said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always wondered why you don&#x2019;t use an Argonian for that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t trust &#x2019;em. Besides, they have ripper eels trained to hunt Argonians trying to cross the outer canal. They&#x2019;re not so good at spotting me, especially if I rub myself with eel-slime first.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Disgusting. You can keep your end of the job.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just as long as I get paid for it.&#x201d; He pulled off his shirt and removed his hump. &#x201c;Have a look. Have a taste, if you want.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, daedra and Divines,&#x201d; Anna�g swore, from the beam they crouched on. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not a were-croc. He&#x2019;s a skooma smuggler.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re finally going to kill me,&#x201d; Glim said.<br><br>&#x201c;Not so much kill you as get you killed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It works out the same.&#x201d;<br><br>And now Anna�g was quite sure that what she felt was fear. Bright, terrible, animal fear.<br><br>&#x201c;By the way,&#x201d; the Khajiit below said, lowering his voice. &#x201c;Who are those two in the rafters?&#x201d;<br><br>The man looked up. &#x201c;Xhuth! if I know,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;None of mine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I hope not. I sent Patch and Flichs up to kill them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, kaoc&#x2019;,&#x201d; Anna�g hissed. &#x201c;Come on, Glim.&#x201d;<br><br>As she stood, something wisped through the air near her, and a shriek tore out of her throat.<br><br>&#x201c;I knew it,&#x201d; Glim snapped.<br><br>&#x201c;Just&#x2014;come on, we have to get to the roof.&#x201d;<br><br>They ran across the beams, and someone behind her shouted. She could hear their footfalls now&#x2014;why hadn&#x2019;t she before? An enchantment of some sort?<br><br>&#x201c;There.&#x201d; Glim said. She saw it; part of the roof had caved in and was resting on the rafters, forming a ramp. They scrambled up it. Something hot and wet was trying to pull out of her chest, and she hysterically wondered if an arrow hadn&#x2019;t hit her, if she wasn&#x2019;t bleeding inside.<br><br>But they made it to the roof.<br><br>And a fifty-foot fall.<br><br>She pulled out two vials and handed one to Mere-Glim.<br><br>&#x201c;Drink this and jump,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;What? What is it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s&#x2014;I&#x2019;m not sure. It&#x2019;s supposed to make us fly.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Supposed to? Where did you get it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why is that important?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, Thtal, you made it didn&#x2019;t you? Without a formula. Remember that stuff that was supposed to make me invisible?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It made you sort of invisible.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It made my skin translucent. I looked like a bag of offal walking around.&#x201d;<br><br>She drank hers. &#x201c;No time, Glim. It&#x2019;s our only hope.&#x201d;<br><br>Their pursuers were coming up the ramp, so she jumped, wondering if she should flap her arms or . . .<br><br>But what she did was fall, and shriek.<br><br>But then she wasn&#x2019;t falling so fast, and then she was sort of drifting, so the wind actually pushed her like a soap bubble. She heard the men hollering from the roof, and turned to see Glim floating just behind her.<br><br>&#x201c;See?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You need to have a little faith in me.&#x201d;<br><br>She barely got the sentence out before they were falling again.<br>Later, battered, sore, and stinking of the trash pile that broke their final fall, they returned to her father&#x2019;s villa. They found him passed out in the same chair Anna�g had been in earlier that morning. She stood looking at him for a moment, at his pale fingers clutched on a wine bottle, at his thinning gray hair. She was trying to remember the man he had been before her mother died, before the An-Xileel wrested Lilmoth from the Empire and looted their estates.<br><br>She couldn&#x2019;t see him.<br><br>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; she told Glim.<br><br>They took three bottles of wine from the cellar and wound their way up the spiral stair to the upper balcony. She lit a small paper lantern and in its light poured full two delicate crystal goblets.<br><br>&#x201c;To us,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>They drank.<br><br>Old Imperial Lilmoth spread below them, crumbling hulks of villas festooned with vines and grounds overgrown with sleeping palms and bamboo, all dark now as if cut from black velvet, except where illumined by the pale phosphorescences of lucan mold or the wispy yellow airborne shines, harmless cousins of the deadly will-&#x2019;o-wisps in the deep swamps.<br><br>&#x201c;There now,&#x201d; she said, refilling her glass. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you feel more alive?&#x201d;<br><br>He blinked his eyes, very slowly. &#x201c;Well, I certainly feel more aware of the contrast between life and death,&#x201d; he replied.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a start,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>A small moment passed.<br><br>&#x201c;We were lucky,&#x201d; Glim said.<br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;But . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s no were-croc, but we can at least report the skooma dealers to the underwarden.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll have moved by then. And even if they catch them, that&#x2019;s a drop of water in the ocean. There&#x2019;s no stopping the skooma trade.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There certainly isn&#x2019;t if no one tries,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;No offense, Glim, but I wish we were still in the Empire.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No doubt. Then your father would still be a wealthy man, and not a poorly paid advisor to the An-Xileel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I just&#x2014;there was justice under the Empire. There was honor.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You weren&#x2019;t even born.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, but I can read, Mere-Glim.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But who wrote those books? Bretons. Imperials.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And that&#x2019;s An-Xileel propaganda. The Empire is rebuilding itself. Titus Mede started it, and now his son Attrebus is at his side. They&#x2019;re bringing order back to the world, and we&#x2019;re just&#x2014;just dreaming ourselves away here, waiting for things to get better by themselves.&#x201d;<br><br>The Argonian gave his imitation shrug. &#x201c;There are worse places than Lilmoth.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There are better places, too. Places we could go, places where we could make a difference.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is this your Imperial City speech again? I like it here, Nn. It&#x2019;s my home. We&#x2019;ve known each other since we were hatchlings, yes, and if you didn&#x2019;t already know you could talk me into almost anything, you do now. But leaving Black Marsh&#x2014;that you won&#x2019;t get me to do. Don&#x2019;t even try.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you want more out of life, Glim?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Food, drink, good times&#x2014;why should anyone want more than that? It&#x2019;s people wanting to &#x2018;make a difference&#x2019; causing all the troubles in the world. People who think they know what&#x2019;s better for everyone else, people who believe they know what other people need but never bother to ask. That&#x2019;s what your Titus Mede is spreading around&#x2014;his version of how things ought to be, right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There is such a thing as right and wrong, Glim. Good and evil.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If you say so.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Prince Attrebus rescued an entire colony of your people from slavery. How do you think they feel about the Empire?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My people knew slavery under the old Empire. We knew it pretty well.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, but that was ending when the Oblivion crisis happened. Look, even you have to admit that if Mehrunes Dagon had won, if Martin hadn&#x2019;t beaten him&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Martin and the Empire didn&#x2019;t beat him in Black Marsh,&#x201d; Glim said, his voice rising. &#x201c;The An-Xileel did. When the gates opened, Argonians poured into Oblivion with such fury and might, Dagon&#x2019;s lieutenants had to close them.&#x201d;<br><br>Anna�g realized that she was leaning away from her friend and that her pulse had picked up. She smelled something sharp and faintly sulfurous. Amazed, she regarded him for a moment.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she finally said, when the scent diminished, &#x201c;but without Martin&#x2019;s sacrifice, Dagon would have eventually taken Black Marsh, too, and made this world his sportground.&#x201d;</p><h2>Rainbow Magic: My A to Z of Fairies</h2><p>No Rainbow Magic fan should be without this sparkling compendium of fairy fun.

Because you want foods that both taste good and are good for you, this cookbook offers many choices ranging from appetizers to desserts, all high in flavor but low in unhealthy nutrients including sodium, added sugars, saturated fat, and trans fat. Saturated and trans fats are dietary villains that cause blood levels of harmful low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL, the &#x201c;bad&#x201d; cholesterol) to rise. That&#x2019;s a serious concern because higher levels of LDL cholesterol circulating in your blood are a major risk factor for heart disease.<br><br>You can take three important steps to help manage your risk of heart disease. First, evaluate your personal situation and identify all your risk factors. Second, take steps to control your LDL cholesterol level&#x2014;and other risk factors&#x2014;by making smart decisions about your diet and lifestyle. Third, commit to making good choices for the long term to live a longer, healthier life.<br><br>KNOW YOUR RISK<br><br>The first step is to assess your individual risk for heart disease. Risk factors are the behaviors and conditions that increase your chance of developing a disease. Some risk factors&#x2014;aging, your medical history, and the medical history of your family&#x2014;can&#x2019;t be changed. (For more information, see Appendix E on page 348.) Fortunately, many risk factors can be changed. Lifestyle choices such as smoking and physical inactivity, as well as conditions such as high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, being overweight or obese, and diabetes, are all factors that you can do something about. In fact, heart disease is largely preventable. If you don&#x2019;t know your numbers for blood cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood glucose, visit your healthcare provider and find out what they are. Be sure to schedule regular visits with your healthcare provider to monitor your individual situation. Depending on your cholesterol levels and your other risk factors, decide together on target goals and the best approach for reaching them.<br><br>REDUCE YOUR RISK<br><br>By changing your habits, especially your dietary and lifestyle choices, you can help reduce your level of blood cholesterol as well as other risk factors. How much you have to modify your diet and lifestyle depends on several things, including your other risk factors and how your body responds to changes in your diet. For many people, relatively minor changes can reduce their risk significantly. Others need to make more extensive lifestyle changes. Eating well and being physically active are the best ways to control your LDL cholesterol level and other modifiable risk factors.<br><br>Eating a Heart-Healthy Diet<br><br>The more research we do, the more we understand how the foods we eat affect the levels of cholesterol in our blood. What actually is cholesterol? Cholesterol is a waxy substance that comes from two sources: your body and food. Your body, and especially your liver, makes all the cholesterol you need and circulates it through the blood. But cholesterol is also found in foods from animal sources, such as meat, poultry, and full-fat dairy products. Your liver produces more cholesterol when you eat a diet high in saturated and trans fats. That&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s important to know what you&#x2019;re eating and what to cut back on to keep your blood cholesterol low. To achieve a heart-healthy diet, it&#x2019;s important to replace foods that are high in saturated fat and trans fat, as well as in sodium and added sugars, with nutritious foods.<br><br>Being Physically Active<br><br>In addition to eating nutritiously, we know that maintaining a healthy lifestyle&#x2014;especially by staying physically active&#x2014;is an important step to reduce your risk for heart disease and stroke. You can help lower your cholesterol primarily by getting regular exercise and managing your weight.<br><br>If your healthcare provider prescribes cholesterol-lowering drugs, you still should modify your diet and lifestyle. These changes not only lower cholesterol but also help control many of the other risk factors for heart disease, including high blood pressure, being overweight or obese, and diabetes.<br><br>COMMIT TO A LIFETIME OF HEALTHY CHOICES<br><br>Finally, managing your risk means committing to a lifestyle that promotes a longer, healthier life. If you eat wisely, stay physically active, take statins (if prescribed), and follow the recommendations of your healthcare provider, chances are you will:<br><br>Reduce your likelihood of developing high blood cholesterol if you don&#x2019;t have it.<br><br>Reduce your cholesterol levels if they are high.<br><br>Reduce your risk of developing heart disease and having a stroke.<br><br>By consistently making healthy decisions throughout your life, you are taking an active role in managing your well-being. The smart choices you make today can bring long-lasting benefits to you and your family for many years to come.<br><br>healthy food, healthy heart<br><br>One of the best ways to take care of your heart is to understand the fundamentals of good nutrition and apply them in your everyday life. Once you have this information, you can build a heart-smart eating plan using our recipes and creatively adapting your own.<br><br>THE ESSENTIALS TO EATING WELL<br><br>As you plan your meals at home&#x2014;and when you make food choices away from home&#x2014;what matters most is to establish a well-balanced diet that provides variety among the food groups. If one day you eat too much of something you are trying to limit, be mindful of that and eat less in the following days to get back in balance. It is possible to satisfy your personal preferences and still be sure you get all the components of a healthy diet while limiting the less healthy foods.<br><br>Follow these basic nutrition guidelines for an overall healthy eating pattern:<br><br>Eat lots of different fruits and vegetables.<br><br>Make sure at least half of the grains you eat are whole-grain foods.<br><br>Include fat-free and low-fat dairy products.<br><br>Eat fish (especially those rich in omega-3 fatty acids) at least twice a week.<br><br>Choose lean meats and poultry without skin and prepare them without added saturated and trans fats.<br><br>Limit foods that contain &#x201c;bad&#x201d; fats (saturated and trans) and replace with those that contain &#x201c;good&#x201d; fats (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated).<br><br>Choose and prepare foods with little or no salt.<br><br>Reduce your consumption of beverages and foods with added sugars.<br><br>Fruits and Vegetables<br><br>Vegetables and fruits are great examples of nutrient-rich foods whether they are fresh, frozen, or canned. They are low in calories but provide important vitamins, minerals, fiber, and other nutrients. Try to eat the rainbow of fruits and vegetables to get the widest variety, such as (green) spinach, kale, collard greens, mustard greens, romaine lettuce; (red) tomatoes, beets, red bell pepper, raspberries; and (orange) carrots, sweet potatoes, pumpkins, mangoes, cantaloupes, apricots.<br><br>Healthy Hnts<br><br>Look for no-salt-added or low-sodium versions of canned vegetables and beans. Manufacturers continue to bring out new products to meet the demand for more-healthful choices.<br><br>For canned fruits, read the ingredient labels to find options with the least amount of added sugar. Fruits that are canned in water are lower in calories than fruits canned in juice or syrup. Rinsing and draining both canned fruits and vegetables before you use them reduces sugar and sodium even further.<br><br>Grains<br><br>Any food made of wheat, rice, oats, corn, or another cereal is a grain product. Bread, pasta, oatmeal, and grits are all grain products. There are two main types of grain products: whole grains and refined grains. Try to eat whole-grain products for at least half of your daily servings.<br><br>Whole grains are high in fiber and complex carbohydrates and low in saturated fat, and they are a healthier choice than refined grains. Whole grains contain the entire grain&#x2014;the bran, germ, and endosperm. Healthy choices include whole-wheat flour, oatmeal, corn, whole-grain cornmeal, brown rice, quinoa, buckwheat, wild rice, barley, bulgur, and whole-grain cereals and breads.<br><br>On the other hand, refined grains have been milled (ground into flour or meal), which results in the bran and germ being removed. This process removes much of the B vitamins, iron, and dietary fiber. Most refined grains are enriched, which means that some of the B vitamins and iron are added back after processing. Fiber, however, is not added back to enriched grains. Some sources of enriched grains are wheat flour, enriched bread, and white rice.<br><br>Healthy Hints<br><br>To find grains in their whole form, look beyond the labeling on the packaging and read the ingredients list. When choosing a bread, cereal, or grain product, look for those that list the whole grain as the first ingredient on the label.<br><br>Most commercial muffins, cakes, pies, doughnuts, and cookies are not made with whole grains, and they are high in calories and low in important nutrients. To enjoy these occasional treats, bake them at home using whole-wheat flour, unsaturated oils, and fruits or vegetables. For some delicious ideas, see &#x201c;Breads and Breakfast Dishes&#x201d; (page 277) and &#x201c;Desserts&#x201d; (page 293).<br><br>Commercial products are being reformulated to avoid the use of trans fat, but check nutrition labels for partially hydrogenated oils before you buy.<br><br>Dairy Products<br><br>Dairy foods are an important part of a healthy diet, providing calcium and protein. All adults ages 19 to 50 should aim to consume 1,000 milligrams of calcium each day (for maximal calcium retention). For adults ages 51 and older, that amount increases to 1,200 milligrams. Most healthcare providers encourage women in particular to eat fat-free and low-fat dairy products to get calcium. This helps reduce their risk of developing the bone disease osteoporosis. So many fat-free and low-fat dairy options are now available that you can easily avoid the high levels of saturated fat found in whole milk and whole-milk products. Healthy choices include fat-free or low-fat milk, cheeses, yogurt, sour cream, and cream cheese. To see the difference, take a look at the nutrition labels and compare a cup of whole milk to a cup of fat-free milk, for example. By choosing the fat-free version, you&#x2019;ll save about 65 calories and 4.5 grams of saturated fat.<br><br>Healthy Hints<br><br>Keep in mind that many cheeses are high in saturated fat and that many fat-free or low-fat products have high levels of sodium and added sugars. Be sure to read the nutrition facts labels and compare products.<br><br>If you&#x2019;re used to whole-milk products (3.5% fat), you may find it easier to taper off slowly. Try 1% low-fat milk first, then change to �% low-fat milk. Soon you&#x2019;ll be able to switch to fat-free milk with no trouble.<br><br>If you choose not to consume dairy products, other good sources of calcium include green vegetables such as spinach, kale, and broccoli, and some legumes and soybean products.<br><br>Fish and Seafood<br><br>Research suggests that increased intake of oily fish that contain omega-3 fatty acids&#x2014;such as salmon, lake trout, herring, sardines, mackerel, and albacore tuna&#x2014;reduces the risk of death from coronary artery disease. Aim to eat at least two servings of fish that&#x2019;s rich in omega-3 fatty acids every week. If you already have heart disease or high blood triglyceride levels, your healthcare professional may recommend fish oil supplements to help increase your intake of omega-3 fatty acids.<br><br>Shellfish, such as shrimp, squid, scallops, mussels, and clams, is low in saturated fat, so it&#x2019;s a good source of heart-healthy protein. There are also several tasty and healthy ways to prepare shellfish that don&#x2019;t add a lot of saturated and trans fats or sodium.<br><br>Healthy Hints<br><br>Canned tuna is an easy way to get in omega-3s. Choose a very low sodium product and be sure it&#x2019;s packed in water or in a vacuum-sealed pouch.<br><br>Although nearly all fish and shellfish may contain trace amounts of mercury or other contaminants, the health risks from mercury exposure depend on the levels of mercury in the fish itself and the amount of seafood eaten. Eating a variety of fish will help minimize the possible adverse effects caused by pollutants in the environment. The FDA recommends that women who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or nursing&#x2014;and young children&#x2014;should avoid eating four types of fish with high mercury levels: tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico, shark, swordfish, and king mackerel. For most people, however, the benefits of eating fish far outweigh the risks.<br><br>Choose low-sodium, low-fat seasonings, such as spices, herbs, and lemon juice, when you cook fish.<br><br>Poultry and Meat<br><br>Lean skinless poultry and lean meat are delicious sources of essential protein. Protein helps you to feel full and satisfied until your next meal, and it&#x2019;s critical for building muscle to keep you strong, especially as you grow older. The American Heart Association recommends consuming no more than 6 ounces of cooked lean skinless poultry or lean meat each day.<br><br>Healthy choices include skinless chicken and turkey, all cuts; lean beef cuts, such as sirloin, round steak, and rump roast; extra-lean ground beef; lean pork cuts, such as loin chops, tenderloin, and the lowest sodium available center-cut ham and Canadian bacon. Try to limit your consumption of red meat.<br><br>Healthy Hints<br><br>Choose whole turkeys or turkey breasts that haven&#x2019;t been injected with broth or fats.<br><br>Buy USDA Select grades of meat. They have less marbling than Prime or Choice.<br><br>Be sure to discard any visible fat.<br><br>When figuring serving sizes, remember that poultry (and meat) loses about 25 percent of its weight during cooking. (For example, 4 ounces of raw poultry [or meat] will weigh about 3 ounces when cooked.)<br><br>Chill meat juices from cooking so you can easily skim off fat that hardens on the surface before you use those juices to make gravy, stews, or soups.<br><br>Limit processed meats, such as bacon, hot dogs, bologna, salami, and sausage. They are often high in saturated fat and sodium. Reduced-fat, low-fat, and/or fat-free versions of these meats are available, but watch out for high sodium. Compare labels to find the brands that are lowest in calories, saturated fat, and sodium.<br><br>Legumes, especially dried beans and peas, are also rich in fiber and provide protein. They are excellent alternatives to animal sources of protein that contain saturated fat. Also include a variety of legumes, such as green peas, black-eyed peas, chickpeas, kidney beans, navy beans, and lentils.<br><br>Fats and Oils<br><br>It&#x2019;s the type of fat more than how much fat you consume that most affects your blood cholesterol level. The main types of fat in foods are saturated fat, trans fat, and unsaturated fat. Saturated fats are found in animal products and in some tropical oils. Trans fat is found primarily in commercial products made with or fried in partially hydrogenated oils. Both of these types are the harmful fats and raise LDL cholesterol in the blood. Aim to get no more than 5 to 6 percent of calories from saturated fat and to reduce the percentage of calories from trans fat. For example, if you eat about 2,000 calories a day, you should limit your consumption of saturated fat to less than 13 grams (6 percent of 2,000 calories is 120 calories, divided by 9 calories, which are roughly equal to 1 gram of fat). You can find how much saturated fat is in foods by reading the nutritional analyses for recipes and reading the Nutrition Facts panels on food labels.</p><h2>Grimms&#39; Fairy Tales (Puffin Classics)</h2><p>From the land of fantastical castles, vast lakes and deep forests, the Brothers Grimm collected a treasury of enchanting folk and fairy stories full of giants and dwarfs, witches and princesses, magical beasts and cunning children.

Ideally those two would line up together and the world would be full of good, masculine men who dress and look like good masculine men. But all too often, reality is something different. There are good men and strong leaders out there who dress and look like children or bums. There are awful, lazy men in the world who dress in a way that hides their vices from those around them and makes them appear better than they truly are. In an attempt to correct for these disparities, our current culture tries to rob both appearance of its power and power of its appearance - to say that the way a person dresses or looks doesn&#x2019;t - or at least shouldn&#x2019;t matter. We&#x2019;re given platitudes like, &#x201c;don&#x2019;t judge a book by its cover&#x201d; and there&#x2019;s a often a cultural rush to prove ourselves as non-judgmental as we can. But a man&#x2019;s appearance has been an integral part of humanity since before the dawn of civilization. As human beings we use mental shortcuts when assessing our surroundings and the people within them. It is inefficient and dangerous to treat every object, scenario, and person as a blank slate or an unknown. And, because it is our tendency to judge according to visual stimuli, we use physicality, body language, grooming, and clothing to quickly and effectively communicate who we are and how we want other people to perceive us. Some men dress to appear more physically threatening, others to convey status and power within social spheres, some attempt to fit in and not draw attention to themselves, and others will use their clothing to show their disdain for the social norms around them. Regardless of what your intentions are, your clothing says something about you. And no, this doesn&#x2019;t just apply to you, but to every man who has ever interacted with another human being. From the ancient shaman, to the Wall Street banker, the Pope to the gutter punk, all men use clothing and appearance to tell the world who we are. Which means it&#x2019;s worthwhile for you to understand how to use this tool effectively. The purpose of this book is to outline the underlying principles of how clothing affects men and masculinity. Understanding and applying those principles will take you far beyond looking like you&#x2019;ve been dressed by an image consultant, in one of his five variations of acceptable clothing, and into the realm of being well-dressed all the time.</p><p></p><h2>Y: The Last Man Book Four</h2><p>In 2002, the world changes forever.

This visual reference includes an introduction to architecture design, historical view of the elements, as well as an overview of how these elements can and have been used across multiple design disciplines.

Soderman <p><b></b></p> <b>Environmental Context</b> <p></p> <p>One of the most important and pressing aspects of the design of a structure is its environmental context, a context that can either affect the building positively (as provide warmth or shade) or extremely negatively (as in erosion or collapse). Most characteristic of this context is that it is continuously transforming, either in predictable or unanticipated ways. And the building in turn has a responsibility toward that context: perhaps at worst it will coexist, but at best it will enhance it.</p> <p><b></b></p> <b>Extreme Variability</b> <p></p> <p>Architecture has a responsibility to anticipate that the environment in which it is situated will change, and often in quite unpredictable ways. Extreme weather&#x2014;floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, and avalanches&#x2014;introduce design parameters that situate a work in a specific environmental context. A building erected in a flood plain might be raised on stilts while one in a frequent avalanche zone might be wedge shaped and embedded into the mountainside.</p> <p><b></b></p> <b>Weather</b> <p></p> <p>Rates of environmental change can be more predictable, from a twenty-four-hour cycle to seasonal variations. A building&#x2019;s anticipation of the behaviors of basic yet constantly changing environmental elements of sun, rain, and wind cannot only be traced in the placement and dimension of apertures, the slopes of roofs, and the materials used, but in the more fundamental placement of a building within its actual physical site.</p> <br> <p><b></b></p> <p></p><p>Val Warke is an associate professor at Cornell University's Department of Architecture, where he has been a department chair, a director of graduate studies, and the coordinator of the first year B.Arch. program.

Ever since they first met and fell in love at university, Yejide and Akin have agreed: polygamy is not for them. But four years into their marriage&#x2014;after consulting fertility doctors and healers, and trying strange teas and unlikely cures&#x2014;Yejide is still not pregnant. She assumes she still has time&#x2014;until her in-laws arrive on her doorstep with a young woman they introduce as Akin&#x2019;s second wife. Furious, shocked, and livid with jealousy, Yejide knows the only way to save her marriage is to get pregnant. Which, finally, she does&#x2014;but at a cost far greater than she could have dared to imagine. The unforgettable story of a marriage as seen through the eyes of both husband and wife, <i>Stay With Me</i> asks how much we can sacrifice for the sake of family.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of August 2017:</strong> &#x201c;This book nearly destroyed me; you gotta read it." That&#x2019;s what a colleague said to me about Ayobami Adebayo&#x2019;s searing debut novel, <em>Stay with Me</em> (and not sadistically!). Taking place in Nigeria, it's the story of Yejide and Akin--a young married couple who are experiencing fertility issues. When the in-laws&#x2019; solution is a second wife, they conspire separately to save their relationship, with devastating consequences. I quickly gathered what my colleague meant--much of this novel is a series of unfortunate events. So much so, and sometimes to such cinematic extremes, that when Adebayo interjects humor into the narrative, it&#x2019;s easily mistaken for something sinister (even when it involves breastfeeding a goat). But her gift is making these extremes make sense. After all, it&#x2019;s some of our most intimate and profound struggles that can compel us to react in the craziest of ways&#x2014;ways that just might destroy what was meant to be preserved. Adebayo is such a skilled storyteller that you will forgive Yejide and Akin some serious trespasses; you will weep for their once-happy union that buckles so spectacularly beneath the weight of cultural pressures--pressures that warp their sense of what constitutes a worthwhile life. The couple&#x2019;s efforts to disentangle their true desires from the ones tradition and society have foisted upon them is what imbues <em>Stay with Me</em> with unexpected power, and heart. You definitely gotta read it. <em>--Erin Kodicek, Amazon Book Review</em>Ayobami Adebayo&#x2019;s stories have appeared in a number of magazines and anthologies, and one was highly commended in the 2009 Commonwealth Short Story Competition.

Her husband and teenage daughter have been coping with Billie&#x2019;s death the best they can: Jonathan drinks as he works on a loving memoir about his marriage; Olive grows remote, from both her father and her friends at the all-girls school she attends.<br><br> But then Olive starts having strange visions of her mother, still alive.

An essayist and a journalist, she has written for <i>Vogue, The New York Times, Elle, Wired, Self, </i>the<i> Los Angeles Times, Salon, </i>and numerous other publications. She lives in Los Angeles with her husband and their two children.<p>1<br> Olive is crossing from the Sunshine Wing to the Redwood Wing, on her way to her third-period English class, when her dead mother appears for the first time. Weaving through the eddies of girls, twenty-six pounds of textbooks tugging at her shoulder, the blue skirt of her uniform clinging stubbornly to her thighs, Olive suddenly feels as if she might faint. She assumes at first that she is just overheating. Claremont Prep is housed in a rambling nineteenth-century Craftsman mansion that has been neglected in the name of &#x201c;authenticity&#x201d;--the knobs to the classrooms are all original cut crystal and spin uselessly when you turn them, and the windows don&#x2019;t actually open because they&#x2019;ve been lacquered over too many times, and Olive often has to take cold showers after badminton practice because the boiler can&#x2019;t keep up with the demand of twelve girls simultaneously shaving their legs--and on rainy days, like this one, the overworked furnace fills the hallways with a moist fug of girl-scented heat.<br> &nbsp;<br> Olive stops and presses her hand against the cool glass of a display case to stabilize herself. She digs in her backpack for a bottle of water and closes her eyes. She feels as if she is standing at the center of a turntable, the hallway whipping around her in dizzying circles. She catches an acrid whiff, as if something is burning.<br> &nbsp;<br> When she opens her eyes again, she is somewhere else entirely. Or, rather, she is still in the main hall of Claremont Prep--she senses the thrum of bodies swinging past, the drumming of the rain against the stained-glass clerestory windows--but somehow she is also somewhere else entirely. A beach, to be exact.<br> &nbsp;<br> The beach isn&#x2019;t really there, of course it&#x2019;s not, and yet . . . there it is: the overcast sky, the pebbly sand, the dunes lashed with sea grass, waves that are dark and hungry. She can almost feel her Converse sneakers shifting in the sand, the salty air sticking to her skin. This alternate world seems to exist as an overlay draped across her surroundings: Through the waves Olive is dimly aware of two other junior girls--Ming and Tracy--hanging up posters for the Fall Frolic; and just behind the ragged dunes is a line of lockers; and somewhere inside that thrashing surf is the double-doored entrance of the Redwood Wing. It is as if the two worlds exist simultaneously, each overlapping the other, a kind of waking dream.<br> &nbsp;<br> She blinks. It doesn&#x2019;t go away.<br> &nbsp;<br> The time they gave her nitrous at the dentist&#x2019;s office: That&#x2019;s how she feels now, her brain opaque, diffuse, as if someone has reset its dial at half speed. Time seems to have stopped, or at least slowed. She senses her body tipping backward, the backpack full of books losing the battle against gravity. The third-period bell is ringing somewhere faintly in the distance.<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s when she sees her mother.<br> &nbsp;<br> Billie stands a few yards away, right where the sea meets the sand, the water slapping at her bare toes. It is as if she&#x2019;s been standing there the whole time and Olive has only just grown aware of her.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her mother&#x2019;s hair is long and loose, the brown giving way to silver at the part. It flies in a wild halo around her face. She is wearing a gauzy white dress that whips around her bare legs as the wind blows off the sea, its hem dark with ocean spray. Her mom was never a wearer of dresses (she tended toward performance fleece), so this strikes Olive as slightly weird (as if nothing else happening here is weird?), but still. It&#x2019;s her. Mom. Olive feels the word swell up inside her, painfully filling her lungs until it stops her breath entirely.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Olive!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Despite her diaphanous appearance, Billie&#x2019;s voice isn&#x2019;t at all spectral; it&#x2019;s strong and clear, as if right inside Olive&#x2019;s brain, and loud enough to drown out the frothy shrieks of the girls down the hall. Olive opens her own mouth and gasps out the only word that she can muster: &#x201c;Mom?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Olive,&#x201d; Billie says, her voice lower now, almost chiding. &#x201c;I miss you. Why aren&#x2019;t you looking?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Looking for what?&#x201d; She&#x2019;s hallucinating, isn&#x2019;t she? She isn&#x2019;t really talking to her dead mom. She closes her eyes and opens them again.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her mom is still there, looking amused. She smiles, revealing deep grooves in her sun-etched face, and she outstretches her hand as if to take Olive&#x2019;s own. &#x201c;Olive,&#x201d; she says with a note of disappointment in her voice. &#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t trying hard enough.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> There&#x2019;s a burning sensation in Olive&#x2019;s chest that&#x2019;s making it hard to breathe. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m trying as hard as I can, Mom,&#x201d; Olive whispers, tears welling up in her eyes, but the weird thing is that she doesn&#x2019;t feel sad, not at all. She feels almost . . . transcendent, as if she&#x2019;s thisclose to getting the answer to some vital question that will make everything clear.<br> &nbsp;<br> And then it comes to her, the answer she&#x2019;s waiting for. It floods her with a giddy rush: Mom isn&#x2019;t dead.<br> &nbsp;<br> Olive lurches forward with the force of this epiphany. Where did it come from? She takes a step toward her mother, and then another as her mother&#x2019;s figure starts to fade and recede before her; and then she starts to run, although it feels like she is running through wet cement. She feels the backpack slip off her shoulder and slam to the floor behind her. She understands that she needs to grab her mother&#x2019;s outstretched hand, and that if she can somehow seize it, she will be able to drag her mother through that translucent overlay and back to her, back into Olive&#x2019;s world, back to . . .<br> &nbsp;<br> Wham. She runs straight into the wall.<br> &nbsp;<br> Olive is momentarily blinded with pain--a goose egg will later rise on the spot where forehead connected with plaster--and when she can finally see again, her mother is gone.<br> &nbsp;<br> The world comes collapsing back in around her: the rank locker smell of dirty gym clothes and spoiling bananas, the squeak of rubber soles on waxed oak, and the thrilled faces of the three gaping freshmen who have gathered around her, so close that she can feel the heat of their gummy breath.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;OhmyGodareyouOK,&#x201d; says one freshman, an unfortunately pimpled blonde whom Olive has never spoken with before (Holly? Haley?). She leans in as if to touch the lump on Olive&#x2019;s forehead, and Olive flinches.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine, thanks for the concern, really, but it&#x2019;s no big deal,&#x201d; Olive says, smiling apologetically as she backs away. She clocks her backpack on the ground a few feet away and sidles toward it. Ming and Tracy, still on ladders at the end of the hall, have stopped what they are doing and are watching with overt fascination the tableau playing out before them. She waves at them. Tracy waves back with a silly little finger-wiggle, but Ming just stares at Olive, her brow puckering behind the severe curtain of her black bangs.<br> &nbsp;<br> Meanwhile the three freshmen are following closely behind Olive, not ready to give up rubbernecking quite yet. &#x201c;You just ran straight into the wall,&#x201d; Haley/Holly says accusatorily. &#x201c;It was kind of crazytown.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Olive reaches down and grabs her backpack. Its weight in her hand grounds her, and she swings it over her shoulder, then tugs her skirt straight. The presence of the girls makes it hard to hang on to the answer that she just had in her grasp, and she desperately wants to escape so she can think all this over, figure it out. &#x201c;Honestly, it&#x2019;s nothing,&#x201d; she says. The girls continue to peck around her, unsatisfied. Oh, please let me be alone, she thinks. &#x201c;Just,&#x201d; and her voice drops as if letting them in on a secret, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a little hungover. You know?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ohhhhh,&#x201d; the girls say in low knowing voices that fail to conceal their utter unknowingness. Not that Olive knows much, either--she&#x2019;s been hungover exactly once in her life, after a sleepover at Natalie&#x2019;s house during which she polished off half of a leftover bottle of Christmas cr�me de menthe. But one thing she&#x2019;s learned during her five-year career at Claremont Prep is that underclass girls believe there are secrets to a better life that will someday be unlocked, like the upper levels of a videogame, once they are able to drive a car or procure alcohol or get their braces off. She wishes she could tell these girls that things get easier, but in her experience they don&#x2019;t. Not really. (With the possible exception of being able to drive yourself: That is pretty great.) You just discover that there are even bigger, more complicated problems that you have to solve.<br> &nbsp;<br> In any case, with this small untruth, Olive is at last able to untangle herself. She continues to walk in the direction of the Redwood Wing, aware that the girls are whispering behind her. (She hears just a snippet: You know, the girl with the dead mom . . . ) And then, as the warning bell rings, she turns abruptly and exits to the courtyard.<br> &nbsp;<br> The October air is sharp and wet against her face. She stands under the eaves, the rain splattering the rubber shells of her Converses, and tries to focus. Mom isn&#x2019;t dead. She allows herself this thought again, gingerly, as if she&#x2019;s metering out a particularly tasty piece of chocolate cake. The storm rushes through the oak trees, sending a shiver across them, and Olive realizes that she&#x2019;s trembling.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br><br></p></p><h2>Learn Math Fast System Volume III</h2><p>Volume III of the Learn Math Fast System teaches Pre-algebra in just a few months.

In this enticing and practical book, Thomas Sterner demonstrates how to learn skills for any aspect of life, from golfing to business to parenting, by learning to love the process.<br><br>Early life is all about trial-and-error practice. If we had given up in the face of failure, repetition, and difficulty, we would never have learned to walk or tie our shoes. So why, as adults, do we often give up on a goal when at first we don&#x2019;t succeed? In his study of how we learn (prompted by his pursuit of disciplines such as music and golf), Sterner has found that we have forgotten the principles of practice the process of picking a goal and applying steady effort to reach it. The methods Sterner teaches show that practice done properly isn&#x2019;t drudgery on the way to mastery but a fulfilling process in and of itself, one that builds discipline and clarity.</p><p><b>Thomas M. Sterner</b> has studied Eastern and Western philosophy and modern sports psychology and trained as a jazz pianist.

He has also worked in the sound and video arts fields as a recording engineer, audio and video editor and processor, and composer. He is an accomplished musician, private pilot, student of archery, and avid golfer. He lives in Wilmington, Delaware.Everything in life worth achieving requires practice. In fact, life itself is nothing more than one long practice session, an endless effort of refining our motions. When the proper mechanics of practicing are understood, the task of learning something new becomes a stress-free experience of joy and calmness, a process which settles all areas in your life and promotes proper perspective on all of life&#39;s difficulties.</p><h2>Elijah: A Man of Heroism and Humility (5) (Great Lives Series)</h2><p><p>Where are great leaders like Elijah today? Uncompromisingly strong, yet self-controlled. Disciplined, yet forgiving. Audaciously courageous, yet kind. Heroic in the heat of battle, yet humble in the aftermath.</p><p>We see a few such men and women, but the list is tragically short. Rarely does someone model these invaluable traits more obviously than God's mighty prophet Elijah, whose calling was anything but calm and free from conflict. Nevertheless, as you are about to discover in this book. Elijah exemplified true heroism and genuine humility amid the relentless pressure of battle.</p><p><em>Elijah: A Man of Heroism and Humility</em> is the fifth volume in the best-selling Great Lives from God's Word series by Charles Swindoll. The series also includes such powerful biographies as <em>Joseph, David, Esther, </em>and<em> Moses.</em></p><p>Exploring the depths of Elijah's fascinating life as a prophet of God, Swindoll does not gloss over his human weaknesses; rather, he presents an honest picture of this ordinary man who God transformed into His personal spokesman to confront idolatry and evil in the ancient world. You will find that it's a life worth emulating.</p><p>In a world that has lost its way, due in part to the lack of balanced, godly leadership, we are more than ever in need of a few Elijah-like men and women who are not afraid to live courageously among their peers as they walk humbly with their God.</p><p>"May this book establish deep within you a desire to stand strong for what is right as you bow low before Him who is worthy of your trust and obedience."-Charles Swindoll</p></p><p><p>Charles R.

In just 50 pages SuperPuppy will give you clear, concise suggestions covering: choosing a puppy, discipline, chewing, digging, jumping up, housetraining, barking, and nipping. You&#39;ll learn how to communicate better with your dog and how to get the most out of your relationship with one of the most remarkable creatures on earth.</p><p>Peter Vollmer has worked with the Wisconsin Humane Society, Milwaukee Veterinary Medical Association, Hills Pet Products and dog training groups throughout the country to develop pet owner education programs that emphasize the need to begin training early. He received the Dog Writers' Association of America writing award for a series of articles on raising dogs that appeared in Veterinary Medicine/Small Animal Clinician. The book, SuperPuppy: How to Raise the Best Dog You'll Ever Have! developed from that series of articles. <p>Peter currently lives in the San Diego area with his wife, Nancy and their dogs, Blackfoot, Sage and Pinto. They compete in agility and herding trials.</p>One of the first considerations in raising a super puppy is careful selection. Dogs come in all shapes, sizes, coat lengths, colors and dispositions. One area people often overlook when choosing a puppy is a thorough investigation of the particular characteristics that their pup will come to develop. Getting a dog on impulse, based primarily on puppy appearance, is not the best approach. Most pups are cute and cuddly, but puppy "cuteness" is quickly outgrown. <p>If you haven't already acquired a pup, consider whether you have the time necessary to raise him properly - or do you have more pressing considerations? Other responsibilities such as raising small children, school work, or full-time employment, may divert too much of your attention from the pup. Puppies, like small children, need a tremendous amount of social contact and direction in order to develop to their full potential - this means time on your part. Also, think about how its adult size will fit into your home and life-style. Can you provide adequate room for him, and will you be able to fulfill his exercise and grooming requirements. </p><p>Another consideration is temperament - an important aspect that is all too often overlooked. Temperament involves general behavioral tendencies that certain breeds of dogs share or have in common. For example, herding and coursing breeds may be more inclined to chase moving objects than other breeds. Another aspect of temperament is the individual puppy's way of interacting with its world, regardless of its breed or past experiences. </p><p>If you're thinking about a particular breed, take time to identify temperamental characteristics by locating breeders, trainers or pet shops with good reputations as knowledgeable professionals. Perhaps you know someone with a dog you like. Find out from them about the breeder, or ask local veterinarians or members of you local dog club. Honest, reliable breeders will be more than happy to inform you of their breed's qualities, both pro and con, and help you match a breed or individual with your life-style. </p><p>If you have your mind set on adopting a puppy from the local animal shelter, terrific! Just take time to handle more than one prospect, and try to keep an open mind so you can find that special one. The last thing you'll want to do is return the dog because it was the wrong pet for you and the family. </p><p>One more thing. As soon as your veterinarian feels your dog is old enough, have him or her neutered or spayed. This won't alter your dog's personality, but it will make it much, much easier for your pet to live with its human family and for you to live with a four-legged animal. If the dog were living in the wild, it would certainly need those hormones that spay/neuter removes, but the family dog need not, and should not, be under these primitive, hormonal influences. </p><p>Another benefit of early spay/neuter is better health. Animal medical research show that older pet dogs, who were neutered while youngsters had fewer tumors and other related health problems. </p><p>WHAT TO LOOK FOR </p><p>If you haven't already chosen a pup, remember that a great amount of variability exists among individuals, even those of the same breed. So take time to study each prospect. </p><p>Puppies require regular, non-traumatic human contact between the third and sixteenth weeks of life in order to prevent a subsequent fear of people. Researchers have discovered that this process, referred to a primary socialization, can still be accomplished beginning at around the seventh week, even if the dog has had little or no contact with people prior to that time. If you're not sure how the puppy was handled by the breeder or others, select a pup within the seven-week age group. </p><p>When studying a prospect, be aware of any signs of withdrawal from or disinterest in people, as well as signs of being overly pushy. Balance is the key, so look for the well-rounded individual. Stay away from the extremes represented by the fearful litter runt or the bully. </p><p>Finally, handle each prospect individually by performing the subordination exercises beginning on page 6. Remember, you'll have to live with the pup, so select the one that likes to be around you and your family and also the one that you and other family members will be able to manage. </p><p>FINAL PREPARATION </p><p>Once you've decided upon a pup, prepare yourself before you bring him home by carefully reading over the following chapters. Plan his arrival so that you'll have ample time available (such as a weekend or vacation) to begin his life with you properly. Bear in mind that going to a new home will be an abrupt change, so don't pack his first several days with new experiences. Take time to ease the pup into the new routine. Hold off having many visitors or taking him visiting. He first has to adjust to you, your family, and his new surroundings before he's ready for the rest of the world. </p><p>Abrupt changes can produce stress in dogs, and one symptom of stress is loss of appetite - it isn't unusual for a new puppy not to eat for the first 24 hours. A good indication that he's adjusting to his new surroundings is eating. If, however, he continues to refuse all food after 24 hours, a call to your breeder or veterinarian may be in order. </p><p>During the first several days, concentrate on housetraining, introducing the den, and the subordination exercises. And remember always to know where the puppy is and what he's doing. The first 48 hours are important because the puppy's initial impressions can be long remembered, and it's much easier to teach good habits than to change undesirable ones. </p><p>Whether you are about to purchase a pup or have already acquired your puppy, you'll want the read the following recommendations carefully. Raising a puppy to his full potential as a close companion takes insight, patience, compassion, and just plain hard work. But your efforts will pay many, many dividends as your super puppy will grow into a valued family member who'll give you priceless hours of enjoyment and companionship over the years to come.</p></p><h2>The Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal 1870-1914</h2><p><b>The National Book Award&#x2013;winning epic chronicle of the creation of the Panama Canal, a first-rate drama of the bold and brilliant engineering feat that was filled with both tragedy and triumph, told by master historian David McCullough.</b><br><br>From the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author of <i>Truman</i>, here is the national bestselling epic chronicle of the creation of the Panama Canal. In The Path Between the Seas, acclaimed historian David McCullough delivers a first-rate drama of the sweeping human undertaking that led to the creation of this grand enterprise.<br> <br><i>The Path Between the Seas</i> tells the story of the men and women who fought against all odds to fulfill the 400-year-old dream of constructing an aquatic passageway between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. It is a story of astonishing engineering feats, tremendous medical accomplishments, political power plays, heroic successes, and tragic failures. Applying his remarkable gift for writing lucid, lively exposition, McCullough weaves the many strands of the momentous event into a comprehensive and captivating tale.<br> <br>Winner of the National Book Award for history, the Francis Parkman Prize, the Samuel Eliot Morison Award, and the Cornelius Ryan Award (for the best book of the year on international affairs), <i>The Path Between the Seas</i> is a must-read for anyone interested in American history, the history of technology, international intrigue, and human drama.</p><p>On December 31, 1999, after nearly a century of rule, the United States officially ceded ownership of the Panama Canal to the nation of Panama. That nation did not exist when, in the mid-19th century, Europeans first began to explore the possibilities of creating a link between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through the narrow but mountainous isthmus; Panama was then a remote and overlooked part of Colombia.<p> All that changed, writes David McCullough in his magisterial history of the Canal, in 1848, when prospectors struck gold in California. A wave of fortune seekers descended on Panama from Europe and the eastern United States, seeking quick passage on California-bound ships in the Pacific, and the Panama Railroad, built to serve that traffic, was soon the highest-priced stock listed on the New York Exchange. To build a 51-mile-long ship canal to replace that railroad seemed an easy matter to some investors. But, as McCullough notes, the construction project came to involve the efforts of thousands of workers from many nations over four decades; eventually those workers, laboring in oppressive heat in a vast malarial swamp, removed enough soil and rock to build a pyramid a mile high. In the early years, they toiled under the direction of French entrepreneur Ferdinand de Lesseps, who went bankrupt while pursuing his dream of extending France's empire in the Americas. The United States then entered the picture, with President Theodore Roosevelt orchestrating the purchase of the canal--but not before helping foment a revolution that removed Panama from Colombian rule and placed it squarely in the American camp.</p><p> The story of the Panama Canal is complex, full of heroes, villains, and victims. McCullough's long, richly detailed, and eminently literate book pays homage to an immense undertaking. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>David McCullough has twice received the Pulitzer Prize, for <i>Truman </i>and <i>John Adams</i>, and twice received the National Book Award, for <i>The Path Between the Seas</i> and <i>Mornings on Horseback</i>.

A place where rain didn&#x2019;t fall but the lush green gardens never wilted. Flowers bloomed constantly, filling the air with their intoxicating fragrances. The air itself seemed alive. It was honey sweet and warm and enveloped you in a blanket of peace; it was rich with the sounds of singing birds and filled with insects that never stung. If a bee landed on you, it was only because it wanted to be petted.<br> <br>The buildings in Olympus were as beautiful and unique as the land itself. Most were made of smooth white marble with tall, intricately carved pillars reaching high into the clear blue sky. There were open theaters where the Muses danced and sang for the entertainment of all.<br> <br>The wide cobbled streets were lined with statues of the strongest fighters and heroes. There were no cars or trucks pumping pollution into the air. The Olympians walked or flew wherever they needed to go. Occasionally they would ride in a chariot drawn by magnificent horses.<br> <br>Then there were the libraries, more than Emily could count, containing the texts from the many worlds the Olympians visited and guarded. Some of her favorite books were in the library at Jupiter&#x2019;s palace, brought in especially for her.<br> <br>Emily could never have imagined a more perfect place.<br> <br>But living in Olympus, amid all this splendor, Emily was miserable.<br> <br>She missed her father. She spent every waking moment thinking and worrying about him. He was back in her world, a prisoner of the Central Research Unit. The CRU was a secret government agency obsessed with capturing aliens and anything out of the ordinary to use as weapons. She had been their prisoner for a short time and knew how single-minded and cruel they were. But they still had her father. What were they doing to him? Were they punishing him because of her escape? Had they killed him? So many fears and unanswered questions tore at her heart that she could never be completely happy or stop worrying about him.<br> <br>Even spending time with Pegasus didn&#x2019;t ease the pain. Emily was desperate to get back to New York to find her father, but Jupiter wouldn&#x2019;t let her go. He insisted her place was here among the other Olympians. And with the invading warrior race of Nirads still posing a threat to Olympus, Jupiter couldn&#x2019;t risk sending any of his fighters to Emily&#x2019;s world on a rescue mission. No matter how much she pleaded with the god, he refused to allow her to leave.<br> <br>Emily paused as she walked through the gardens of Jupiter&#x2019;s palace. She raised her face to the sun and felt its warm rays streaming down on her. Was this the same sun that shone in her world? Was her father allowed to see it? From her own experience as a prisoner in the CRU&#x2019;s deep underground facility, she doubted it.<br> <br>Emily felt even more determined. If Jupiter wouldn&#x2019;t let her go, she had no choice but to run away and rescue her father herself. Walking along the stream that coursed through Olympus, she saw a group of beautiful water nymphs splashing on the shore. They waved and called their strange greeting. Moments later they slipped beneath the surface, and the water calmed as if they&#x2019;d never been there.<br> <br>Lost in thought, Emily wasn&#x2019;t paying attention to where she was walking and tripped over a small rock. She cursed and righted herself. On top of everything else, she was still getting used to the new gold leg brace that Vulcan, the armorer of Olympus, had made for her. He had constructed it using the same gold as Pegasus&#x2019;s bridle. A very special gold that was lethal to Nirads. With one brief touch they were badly poisoned. Longer contact proved fatal to the ferocious warriors. With this brace Emily could not only defend herself against the invaders, she could walk and run once again.<br> <br>But learning to get around with the strange device had taken time and effort. Now she could almost move as well as she had before her leg was permanently damaged by the Nirads in New York.<br> <br>She walked toward Jupiter&#x2019;s maze, a large labyrinth built in the middle of a garden and consisting of tall green bushes grown in complicated patterns. It took a lot of practice to navigate it, but Emily and her friends had discovered that the maze was the perfect place to hold private conversations.<br> <br>Emily found her way through the labyrinth, where Pegasus was waiting for her beside the pedestal at the center. The magnificent winged stallion always stole her breath. Standing quietly in the dark of the trees, he glowed brilliant white. His head was high and proud, and his coat shiny and well groomed. There wasn&#x2019;t a feather out of place on his neatly folded wings.<br> <br>When Pegasus saw her, he whinnied excitedly and nodded his head.<br> <br>Beside the winged horse stood Emily&#x2019;s best friend from New York, Joel. Joel&#x2019;s Roman features, black hair, and warm brown eyes always reminded her of the classic Italian paintings she&#x2019;d seen in the art museum. He was no longer the violent, angry boy she had first met. Spending time in Olympus had softened his outer shell of rage and hurt due to the loss of his family. Now he let others see that he had a deeply caring heart and a ready laugh. Joel spent his days working with Vulcan in the Olympus armory. He had even helped design the brace on Emily&#x2019;s leg.<br> <br>Emily looked around. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Paelen?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be here in a few minutes. He had something to pick up.&#x201d; Joel reached for her elbow. &#x201c;Em, you&#x2019;re absolutely sure you want to do this?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What choice have I got?&#x201d; Emily answered. &#x201c;Joel, all I think about is saving my dad. There&#x2019;s nothing else I can do. We wouldn&#x2019;t have to sneak around like this if Jupiter would help!&#x201d; She threw her hands up in frustration. As she brought them down, brilliant flames flashed from her fingertips, hit the edge of her good foot, and scorched the ground around it. Emily howled and hopped in pain.<br> <br>&#x201c;Emily, calm down!&#x201d; Joel warned. &#x201c;You know it gets worse when you&#x2019;re upset.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nuts!&#x201d; she cried. &#x201c;Being the Flame of Olympus is one thing. But constantly setting myself on fire is another!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to calm down,&#x201d; Joel insisted. &#x201c;Remember what Vesta taught you. You can control the Flame if you remain calm.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s easier said than done,&#x201d; Emily complained as she sat down and rubbed her singed foot. Ever since she emerged from the Temple of the Flame, she was discovering powers she couldn&#x2019;t control. Powers that continually set things alight.<br> <br>Joel sat down beside her. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll get your dad out of there. I promise. But you can&#x2019;t help him if you can&#x2019;t control the Flame.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Joel&#x2019;s right.&#x201d; Paelen emerged from the trees behind them. In contrast to Joel, he was small and wiry, and he was able to get into the tiniest of spaces. Paelen had a notorious habit of getting into trouble, but with his crooked grin and dark, sparkling eyes, he always found a way to make Emily smile. &#x201c;And if I were you, I would lower your voices. Half the maze can hear your conversation.&#x201d; He sat down beside Emily and gave her a playful shove. &#x201c;Set yourself on fire again I see.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, I tripped,&#x201d; Emily answered, shoving him back.<br> <br>Paelen smiled his crooked smile. &#x201c;Of course you did; which is why your sandal is charcoal and still smoldering.&#x201d;<br> <br>In the time they&#x2019;d spent in Olympus, Emily had really grown to like Paelen. Between him and Joel, she couldn&#x2019;t have asked for better friends. Paelen was also one of the few Olympians who understood what they&#x2019;d been through as prisoners of the CRU on Governors Island.<br> <br>&#x201c;Speaking of sandals&#x201d;&#x2014;Emily changed the subject&#x2014;&#x201c;you didn&#x2019;t steal Mercury&#x2019;s again, did you?&#x201d; She noticed the winged sandals on his feet.<br> <br>&#x201c;Me? Of course not,&#x201d; Paelen said in mock horror. &#x201c;You know I&#x2019;m no longer a thief. Mercury just gave them to me. He is having another set made for himself.&#x201d; Paelen paused and frowned. &#x201c;He said the sandals prefer to stay with me. I do not understand what he means, but I&#x2019;m not going to say no to such a useful gift.&#x201d; He petted the tiny wings on the sandals. &#x201c;These flying sandals saved our lives in your world and helped us escape the CRU. There is no telling what else they can do.&#x201d; He leaned closer to Emily and eagerly rubbed his hands together. &#x201c;So, tell me. When do we leave for New York?&#x201d;<br> <br>Pegasus stepped forward and started to nicker.<br> <br>Paelen nodded and translated for the others. &#x201c;Pegasus heard Jupiter, Mars, and Hercules talking. They are going on an expedition to see if they can discover how the Nirads entered Olympus in such large numbers without being seen. Until they know and can secure the route, we are still in danger. Pegasus suggests if we are going to go to New York to rescue your father, we should leave once they&#x2019;re gone.&#x201d;<br> <br>Emily rose and kissed the stallion on his soft muzzle. &#x201c;Thank you, Pegasus. That&#x2019;s a great idea.&#x201d; She turned to Joel and Paelen. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s settled, then. The moment Jupiter leaves, we&#x2019;re out of here!&#x201d;<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Quietly they discussed their plans as they strolled through the maze. Emily rested her hand on Pegasus&#x2019;s neck as he walked beside her.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll need some human clothes,&#x201d; Joel mused aloud. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t arrive back in New York dressed like this.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What is wrong with these?&#x201d; Paelen looked down at his tunic. &#x201c;I have always dressed this way.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re kidding, right?&#x201d; Joel smirked. &#x201c;Paelen, we look like rejects from a gladiator movie! Look at me&#x2014;I&#x2019;m wearing a dress!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a tunic,&#x201d; Emily corrected him, &#x201c;and I think it suits you.&#x201d; She looked down at her own beautiful gown made from fine white embroidered silk with an intricate braided gold belt at her waist. The material ended above the golden brace on her damaged left leg, leaving it exposed. Emily had never felt embarrassed revealing the deep, angry scars from the Nirad wounds while she was on Olympus. The Olympians regarded them as a badge of honor. She had earned them in the service of Olympus, and she had learned to be proud of them. But as she gazed down at her leg now, she realized that the deep scars and leg brace wouldn&#x2019;t be viewed as positively in her world.<br> <br>&#x201c;Joel&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; she agreed. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t go back there like this either. We&#x2019;ve got to hide this brace.&#x201d;<br> <br>Pegasus started to neigh, and Paelen translated. &#x201c;If anyone should try to steal it from you, Pegasus would defend you, as would Joel and I.&#x201d; A playful twinkle returned to his eyes. &#x201c;Of course, should that fail, you could always set yourself on fire again. That would surely scare off any attackers!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks, Paelen,&#x201d; Emily teased as she shoved him lightly. Then she patted Pegasus on the neck. &#x201c;And thank you, Pegs. But I still think we will need to find other clothing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Other clothing for what?&#x201d;<br> <br>Emily looked up at the owner of the new voice. Despite all the time they&#x2019;d spent in Olympus, she still couldn&#x2019;t get over the sight of Cupid. Seeing Pegasus&#x2019;s wings had been strange at the beginning. But somehow they suited him. She couldn&#x2019;t imagine him without them. But looking at a teenager with colorful, pheasantlike feathered wings on his back was something else.<br> <br>Cupid pulled in his wings and landed neatly in the maze before them. &#x201c;So, where are you going that you need new clothing?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;None of your business,&#x201d; Joel shot back. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t your mother ever teach you any manners? It&#x2019;s not polite to listen in on other people&#x2019;s conversation.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Cupid said. &#x201c;But she also taught me that when humans and Olympians mix, there is always trouble. And what do I see before my curious eyes? Humans mixing with Olympians.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cupid smiled radiantly at Emily, and it set her heart fluttering. She had a terrible crush on him, and he knew it. He was the most beautiful Olympian she had ever met, with fine features, light sandy blond hair, sapphire blue eyes that sparkled, and skin like polished marble. Though Cupid was very old, he looked no more than sixteen or seventeen.<br> <br>Emily stole a glance at Joel and saw his temper starting to flare. The way Cupid pronounced the word &#x201c;humans&#x201d; was always meant as an insult. &#x201c;Get out of here, Cupid,&#x201d; Joel warned. &#x201c;This is a private conversation, and you are <i>not</i> welcome.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is this true?&#x201d; Cupid said slyly to Emily. &#x201c;Do you really wish me to go?&#x201d;<br> <br>The intensity of his stare kept the words from forming on her lips. Everything about him was trouble. Joel had told her some of the myths concerning Cupid. She knew that, like a coward, he had fled the area when the Nirads first attacked and had stayed away until the danger had gone. Yet despite all this, she couldn&#x2019;t tell him to go.<br> <br>Before the moment became awkward, Pegasus stepped forward and snorted loudly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Trouble?&#x201d; Cupid repeated as he turned and feigned innocence to the stallion. &#x201c;I am not causing trouble. I just wanted to speak with the Flame.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Her name is Emily,&#x201d; Paelen said defensively. He moved to stand in front of Emily to block her from Cupid. &#x201c;Do not call her Flame.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And I told you to leave,&#x201d; Joel added, taking position beside Paelen and crossing his arms over his chest.<br> <br>&#x201c;Or what?&#x201d; Cupid challenged. &#x201c;What will you do to me, human?&#x201d;<br> <br>Once again Pegasus snorted, and he pounded the ground with a golden hoof. There was no mistaking the warning. Emily saw fear rise in Cupid&#x2019;s eyes. Even Paelen took a cautious step back from the stallion.<br> <br>&#x201c;There is no need to lose your temper, Pegasus.&#x201d; Cupid held up his hands in surrender. &#x201c;I shall go.&#x201d;<br> <br>His wings opened as he prepared to fly. But before leaving, Cupid plucked a colorful feather from his right wing and placed it in Emily&#x2019;s hair. &#x201c;Something to put under your pillow to remember me by,&#x201d; he said as he jumped into the air and flapped his large wings. &#x201c;See you later, Flame!&#x201d;<br> <br>Pegasus reared on his hind legs, opened his own huge wings, and shrieked into the sky after him.<br> <br>As Cupid escaped, he turned and waved back at her, laughing as he went.<br> <br>&#x201c;I came this close to hitting him!&#x201d; Joel said, balling his hands into fists.<br> <br>&#x201c;Me too,&#x201d; Paelen said.<br> <br>Pegasus gently nudged Emily and nickered softly.<br> <br>&#x201c;You must stay away from Cupid,&#x201d; Paelen explained. &#x201c;Pegasus says he is trouble. Even more than&#x2014;What?&#x201d; Paelen turned sharply to the stallion. &#x201c;Me? Pegasus, how can you compare Cupid to me? We are nothing alike. I may have been a thief, but Cupid is a troublemaking coward, and I resent being compared to him. And what about you?&#x201d; Paelen turned to Emily. He pulled the feather from her hair and tossed it to the ground. &#x201c;You should have told him to go. Cupid would think nothing of handing you over to the Nirads if it meant saving his own skin and feathers. Stay away from him!&#x201d;<br> <br>Emily watched in complete confusion as Paelen stormed off into the maze and disappeared. Paelen had never shown any trace of anger or raised his voice to her before. &#x201c;What did I do?&#x201d;<br> <br>Joel looked at her in surprise. &#x201c;You really don&#x2019;t know?&#x201d;<br> <br>When she shook her head, he said, &#x201c;Never mind. We&#x2019;ve got bigger things to worry about. You must learn to control those powers of yours before we leave. You&#x2019;ve got your training session with Vesta. Keep it and learn as much as you can.&#x201d;<br> <br>As Joel walked away, Emily turned to Pegasus and shook her head. &#x201c;You know something, Pegs? The older I get, the more confused I get. Can you please tell me what just happened here?&#x201d;<br> <br>Pegasus gently nudged her and led her back toward Jupiter&#x2019;s palace to find Vesta.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Emily spent a long afternoon back in the Temple of the Flame struggling to learn how to master her powers. Vesta tried to teach her, but every time Emily summoned the powers, they became uncontrollable.<br> <br>Ves...</p><h2>I am Billie Jean King (Ordinary People Change the World)</h2><p><b>Billie Jean King is one of the greatest tennis players of all time.

Based on revolutionary research and original studies <i>SuperFreakonomics </i>promises to once again challenge our view of the way the world <i>really </i>works.</p></p><p><b>Book Description</b><br> <p> The <i>New York Times</i> best-selling <i>Freakonomics</i> was a worldwide sensation, selling over four million copies in thirty-five languages and changing the way we look at the world. Now, Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner return with <i>SuperFreakonomics,</i> and fans and newcomers alike will find that the freakquel is even bolder, funnier, and more surprising than the first. </p> <p> Four years in the making, <i>SuperFreakonomics</i> asks not only the tough questions, but the unexpected ones: What's more dangerous, driving drunk or <i>walking</i> drunk? Why is chemotherapy prescribed so often if it's so ineffective? Can a sex change boost your salary? </p> <p> <i>SuperFreakonomics</i> challenges the way we think all over again, exploring the hidden side of everything with such questions as: </p> <p> </p><ul> <li> How is a street prostitute like a department-store Santa?</li> <li> Why are doctors so bad at washing their hands?</li> <li> How much good do car seats do?</li> <li> What's the best way to catch a terrorist?</li> <li> Did TV cause a rise in crime?</li> <li> What do hurricanes, heart attacks, and highway deaths have in common?</li> <li> Are people hard-wired for altruism or selfishness?</li> <li> Can eating kangaroo save the planet?</li> <li> Which adds more value: a pimp or a Realtor?</li> </ul> <p></p> <p> Levitt and Dubner mix smart thinking and great storytelling like no one else, whether investigating a solution to global warming or explaining why the price of oral sex has fallen so drastically.

Test your <i>Superfreakonomics</i> know-how now:<p></p> <b>Question 1:</b> 5 points<br> According to <i>Superfreakonomics</i>, what has been most helpful in improving the lives of women in rural India?<br> A. The government ban on dowries and sex-selective abortions<br> B. The spread of cable and satellite television<br> C. Projects that pay women to not abort female babies<br> D. Condoms made specially for the Indian market<p></p> <b>Question 2:</b> 3 points<br> Among Chicago street prostitutes, which night of the week is the most profitable? <br> A. Saturday<br> B. Monday<br> C. Wednesday<br> D. Friday<p></p> <b>Question 3:</b> 5 points<br> You land in an emergency room with a serious condition and your fate lies in the hands of the doctor you draw. Which characteristic doesn&#x2019;t seem to matter in terms of doctor skill? <br> A. Attended a top-ranked medical school and served a residency at a prestigious hospital<br> B. Is female<br> C. Gets high ratings from peers<br> D. Spends more money on treatment<p></p> <b>Question 4:</b> 3 points<br> Which cancer is chemotherapy more likely to be effective for?<br> A. Lung cancer<br> B. Melanoma<br> C. Leukemia<br> D. Pancreatic cancer<p></p> <b>Question 5:</b> 5 points<br> Half of the decline in deaths from heart disease is mainly attributable to:<br> A. Inexpensive drugs<br> B. Angioplasty<br> C. Grafts<br> D. Stents<p></p> <b>Question 6:</b> 3 points<br> True or False: Child car seats do a better job of protecting children over the age of 2 from auto fatalities than regular seat belts.<p></p> <b>Question 7:</b> 5 points<br> What&#x2019;s the best thing a person can do personally to cut greenhouse gas emissions? <br> A. Drive a hybrid car<br> B. Eat one less hamburger a week<br> C. Buy all your food from local sources<p></p> <b>Question 8:</b> 3 points<br> Which is most effective at stopping the greenhouse effect?<br> A. Public-awareness campaigns to discourage consumption<br> B. Cap-and-trade agreements on carbon emissions<br> C. Volcanic explosions<br> D. Planting lots of trees<p></p> <b>Question 9:</b> 5 points<br> In the 19th century, one of the gravest threats of childbearing was puerperal fever, which was often fatal to mother and child. Its cause was finally determined to be:<br> A. Tight bindings of petticoats early in the pregnancy<br> B. Foul air in the delivery wards<br> C. Doctors not taking sanitary precautions<br> D. The mother rising too soon in the delivery room<p></p> <b>Question 10:</b> 3 points<br> Which of the following were not aftereffects of the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks on September 11, 2001:<br> A. The decrease in airline traffic slowed the spread of influenza.<br> B. Thanks to extra police in Washington, D.C., crime fell in that city.<br> C. The psychological effects of the attacks caused people to cut back on their consumption of alcohol, which led to a decrease in traffic accidents.<br> D. The increase in border security was a boon to some California farmers, who, as Mexican and Canadian imports declined, sold so much marijuana that it became one of the states most valuable crops.<p></p> <b>Answers and Scoring</b><br> Question 1<br> B, Cable and satellite TV. Women with television were less willing to tolerate wife beating, less likely to admit to having a &#x201c;son preference,&#x201d; and more likely to exercise personal autonomy. Plus, the men were perhaps too busy watching cricket.<p></p> Question 2<br> A, Saturday nights are the most profitable. While Friday nights are the busiest, the single greatest determinant of a prostitute&#x2019;s price is the specific trick she is hired to perform. And for whatever reason, Saturday customers purchase more expensive services.<p></p> Question 3<br> C, One factor that doesn&#x2019;t seem to matter is whether a doctor is highly rated by his or her colleagues. Those named as best by their colleagues turned out to be no better than average at lowering death rates--although they did spend less money on treatments.<p></p> Question 4<br> C, Leukemia. Chemotherapy has proven effective on some cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin&#x2019;s disease, and testicular cancer, especially if these cancers are detected early. But in most cases, chemotherapy is remarkably ineffective, often showing zero discernible effect. That said, cancer drugs make up the second-largest category of pharmaceutical sales, with chemotherapy comprising the bulk. <p></p> Question 5<br> A, Inexpensive drugs. Expensive medical procedures, while technologically dazzling, are responsible for a remarkably small share of the improvement in heart disease. Roughly half of the decline has come from reductions in risk factors like high cholesterol and high blood pressure, both of which are treated with relatively inexpensive drugs. And much of the remaining decline is thanks to ridiculously inexpensive treatments like aspirin, heparin, ACE inhibitors, and beta-blockers.<p></p> Question 6<br> False.

Scott Matthews, two Carnegie Mellon researchers. Every time a Prius or other hybrid owner drives to the grocery store, she may be cancelling out its emissions-reducing benefit, at least if she shops in the meat section.

The Japanese fleet off the coast of California was wiped out. An even that Morgan and friends and family only knew about because of the radio broadcasts from the Radio Free Redoubt. So far removed from them it barely warranted notice. That is until the Chinese retaliated by launching a nuclear counter-strike against Mac Dill Air Force base. This, did warrant their attention and had the potential to profoundly impact their lives. As bad as the fear of nuclear fallout was, it wasn&#x2019;t the only threat still haunting northern Lake county. With proof the Russians had pathfinder units on the ground, at a minimum, in the state and discovery of Cuban forces cooperating with them, something had to be done. After encountering armored units and realizing they were ill equipped to deal with the threat, the old man called for help. The call was answered, but would require a near impossible trip by truck to Eglin Air Force base. America was certainly on the ropes, but she wasn&#x2019;t down yet. All Morgan wants to do is protect his family and friends. To restore a normal sense of life. To see to it Mel and his girls are safe and protected. He doesn&#x2019;t want to get involved in these military actions. He&#x2019;s more focused on trying to restore power to town. But his desires are, to use a military term, overtaken by circumstances, and, once again, Morgan and his friends are compelled to get involved. And this time, it will cost them.</p><p></p><h2>Froggy Plays T-ball</h2><p>It&#39;s the first day of T-ball and Froggy can&#39;t wait. In his dreams he&#39;s hitting home runs and waving to the cheering crowd. But things never go quite right for Froggy. After he bonks his pal Max on the head with his bat, throws himself out at first base, and spends his time in the outfield catching real flies with his tongue, Froggy has one last chance to prove he&#39;s a T-ball star.</p><p><b>Jonathan London</b>&nbsp;is the creator of twenty-five books about lovable and enduringly popular Froggy.&nbsp; He is also a poet and a novelist.

He lives in Sarasota, Florida.Kindergarten-Grade 3&#x2013;Froggy is back, and he can't wait to play his first game of T-ball, which his dad is coaching. As usual, Froggy's natural exuberance and excitement are infectious, and the whole family flops off to the ballpark. Once there, he displays a lack of coordination and comprehension (misunderstanding the word home, he runs toward his actual house), but that doesn't get in his way. This story has the familiar (and successful) structure, including italicized sound words (<i>whack!</i>). Froggy's mistakes allow youngsters to learn about the game and its rules. In the end, he is successful, and T-ball is a positive experience for him and his family overall. Remkiewicz's illustrations are easily recognizable, but vibrantly colored here with oranges and greens. This sets Froggy's T-ball experience apart from all the rest.

In the fresh and vivid prose that is his trademark, he not only reveals the celebrated history of bullfighters and warrior kings, painters and processions, cathedrals and olive orchards, he also shares the intimate, often hidden country he came to know, where the congeniality of living souls is thrust against the dark weight of history.

He not only reveals the celebrated Spain of bullfights and warror kings, painters and processions, cathedrals and olive orchards; he also shares the intimate, often hidden Spain he has come to know, where toiling peasants and their honest food, the salt of the shores and the oranges of the inland fields, the congeniality of living souls and the dark weight of history conspire to create a wild, contradictory, passionately beautiful land, the mystery called Iberia.<b>James A. Michener</b> was one of the world&#x2019;s most popular writers, the author of more than forty books of fiction and nonfiction, including the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <i>Tales of the South Pacific, </i>the bestselling novels <i>The Source, Hawaii, Alaska, Chesapeake, Centennial, Texas, Caribbean, </i>and <i>Caravans, </i>and the memoir <i>The World Is My Home</i>. Michener served on the advisory council to NASA and the International Broadcast Board, which oversees the Voice of America. Among dozens of awards and honors, he received America&#x2019;s highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 1977, and an award from the President&#x2019;s Committee on the Arts and Humanities in 1983 for his commitment to art in America.

Yet man continues to live as though the various events happening to him throughout his life are random -- occurring only by "chance." This essay formally presents a Universal Law which not only incorporates all of the existing scientific laws, but also explains the underlying order which governs the conditions of our everyday lives. <p>THE LAW OF WILL: Will power is a force nearer to us than any of the external forms of power which we utilize each day. Yet, from an analytical point of view, the power of will is perhaps the least understood. This essay constructs an unprecedented model of the will force which is used to answer questions such as: what will is, where it comes from, and how we manage to have control over this force. The analysis then turns to the age-old question of whether man really has "free will." </p><p>THE LAW OF LOVE: Psychology and religion both stress that at the very essence of man's being is the yearning for love. But though we have all shared in love, very few people actually understand what is happening when love is felt, or what conditions determine the presence or absence of this force. In this essay a comprehensive model of the love force is constructd based upon the Eastern concept of the seven chakras. Around this model a thorough analysis is conducted which reveals the essential qualities of true love. This essay has been repeatedly praised as one of the clearest eplanations of what is actually going on inside when we "fall in love," as well as clearly explaining how we can consciously come into tune with this inner force.</p></p><p></p><h2>Cdb!</h2><p>U can read this, S?<br> S E-Z! <br><br> Vibrant color brings new life to Caldecott Medal-winning <i>New Yorker</i> cartoonist William Steig's classic puzzle book!</p><p>William Steig--<i>The New Yorker</i> cartoonist and revered creator of the Caldecott Medalist <i>Sylvester and the Magic Pebble</i>, <i>Abel's Island</i>, and dozens of other magnificent books--first wrote and illustrated the original, black-and-white edition of <i>CDB!</i> more than 30 years ago. Adding splashes of watercolor on larger, broader pages (and an answer key in the back!), Steig brings new life to his well-loved favorite. For the uninitiated, "C D B!" translates to "See the bee!" Other letter codes are more challenging, such as the boy leaning on a tree saying "I F-N N-E N-R-G" or a droopy decrepit man slouching in a chair labeled "O-L H." Once you get used to this abbreviated Steig-speak, all (or at least most) will become clear--"X" sometimes means "eggs," "D" is sometimes "the," and "S" can be "is" or "has," for example. Or, you can just read the letters out loud over and over until the proper phrase emerges plain as day. (The pictures help, too, of course!) Those who crave more wordplay will want to explore <i>CDC?</i> This book is nothing less than X-L-N, and no home where words are celebrated should be without it. (Ages 5 to 105) <i>--Karin Snelson</i>William Steig (1907&#x2013;2003) was a cartoonist, illustrator, and author of award-winning books for children.

They believe in balanced budgets, but they have boosted government spending, debt, and pork to record levels. They believe in national security but launched a reckless, ideological occupation in Iraq that has made us tangibly less safe. They have substituted religion for politics and damaged both. </p> <p> In <i>The Conservative Soul</i>, one of the nation's leading political commentators makes an impassioned call to rescue conservatism from the excesses of the Republican far right, which has tried to make the GOP the first fundamentally religious party in American history. In this bold and powerful book, Andrew Sullivan makes a provocative, prescient, and heartfelt case for a revived conservatism at peace with the modern world, and dedicated to restraining government and empowering individuals to live rich and fulfilling lives. </p></p><p><p>Andrew Sullivan is one of today's most provocative social and political commentators. An essayist for <em>Time</em> magazine, a columnist for <em>The Sunday Times</em> of London, and a senior editor at <em>The New Republic</em>, he is also the editor of "The Daily Dish," one of the most widely read political blogs on the Web. He lives in Washington, D.C.</p>I don't spend much time in Washington; maybe it's different down there. But let me tell you, out here in the wilds of the New Jersey suburbs, it is pure hell being a Republican these days, or a conservative, which used to be the same thing. The party I grew up in, which stood for fiscal discipline and strong defense and avoided the sloppiness and stained dresses of so many good-hearted Democratic administrations, seems to have been conquered by people who think stem-cell research is murder, who want to ban unpopular sex acts and who have proven incapable of managing such basic government tasks as disaster relief and a war. A war! That used to be the one thing you knew the GOP could run efficiently. Now, well, now it's gotten to the point where I'm just too embarrassed to admit that I'm a Republican.<p>Conservatism is facing a crisis that won't be solved, one suspects, merely by switching presidents. To those of us far removed from Beltway philosophical battles, Andrew Sullivan -- a columnist for Time magazine, a prominent blogger and a senior editor at the New Republic -- might seem an unusual candidate to parse the problem. He's British. He's Catholic. He's gay. But Sullivan is also smart and well read, and in his new book, The Conservative Soul, he calmly and rationally attempts to deduce the malady that in barely 15 years has rendered Reagan-era conservatism all but unrecognizable.</p><p>The pathogen he identifies is Christian fundamentalism. The Conservative Soul, in fact, is one of several similar books issued this fall that collectively serve as a call to arms to American elites to put down their New York Times crossword puzzles and their glasses of Fum� Blanc and wake up to the idea that the fundamentalists most dangerous to our future are not Islamic and foreign but Christian and homegrown. Sullivan's is at once an obvious yet much-needed siren; his text calls to mind the book Mary Lefkowitz wrote several years back, Not Out of Africa, to rebut charges that the foundations of ancient Greek culture were built by black Africans. Afrocentrism was so nutty that most intellectuals couldn't be bothered to answer it. The same, I fear, is true for Christian fundamentalism. Its political tenets are so addlebrained and its leaders so difficult to take seriously that it's only now -- after the country has been run by a born-again Christian for six years -- that thinkers like Sullivan realize that it's time for reasonable people to do something about it. </p><p>The Conservative Soul, unfortunately, is not only too polite but too high-minded to galvanize anyone without a graduate degree in philosophy. This is not a bad thing, just a warning. If you belong to the Elks Club, apply catsup to your scrambled eggs or have ever read anything by Ann Coulter, this is not a book for you. It is written by a card-carrying intellectual and aimed at card-carrying intellectuals. Sullivan wades deep into the high grasses here; he is more interested in Hegel, Hobbes and Leo Strauss than anyone you've seen arguing on television, much less voted for. Further, the book doesn't really explain how conservatism lost its soul, just that it did, and it doesn't offer any real prescription for getting it back.</p><p>Instead, and this is the book's great value, Sullivan takes us back to basics -- we're talking Plato here -- to remind us of the bedrock differences in the two schools of belief that, like squabbling conjoined twins, inhabit the Republican Party's tortured body. The first half of The Conservative Soul, which explores the philosophical underpinnings of Christian fundamentalism and explains how they are anathema to a free society, made me as angry as anything I've read in months. That there are people in 21st-century America who believe the Bible is literally true, who believe the Earth was created 6,000 years ago, and who believe that our lives today should be dictated by codes of conduct written by people who lived 2,000 years before modern medicine, electricity or equal rights -- and that these same Americans have influence in national affairs -- should infuriate anyone with a functioning mind. Fundamentalism, Sullivan reminds us, is the antithesis of reason. Its adherents -- Christian, Muslim, Jewish or otherwise -- have been handed The Truth and cling to it, facts be damned. Quoting figures as varied as Pope Benedict XVI and Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.), Sullivan repeatedly emphasizes how fundamentalism abhors the thinking mind, insisting that an individual's conscious choices -- whether to have an abortion or what to order at Burger King -- amount to moral anarchy. </p><p>In the book's second half, Sullivan switches from anger to nostalgia, reaching back to remind us of the things that made Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher's brand of conservatism so appealing and so successful as a mode of governance. He traces the influence of fundamentalists to Bill Clinton's various personal deficiencies, which triggered a moral counterattack from Christian leaders who felt they knew something about morality. It's a good story, but Sullivan doesn't tell it with any narrative grace. Instead, he gnashes his teeth in frustration at the changes this period brought to conservatism. It's the hallmark of his book -- a fine intellectual effort that, for all Sullivan's clear thinking and clear prose, probably won't change any minds that fundamentalist beliefs haven't already ossified. </p><p>Reviewed by Bryan Burrough <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

Following a formula that has worked so well in the past, the author offers a ton of facts about bats within a fictional framing story: this time, a trip to the nocturnal house at the zoo. Strong photos work well with the illustrations, which include word balloons and standard text. As Fly Guy and his human friend Buzz walk through the exhibit, they encounter a wide variety of bats and learn about habitat, what bats eat (including the diet of the ever-popular vampire bat), how they fly, echolocation, and more. The pronunciation for potentially difficult words is provided, along with a clear definition; however, there is no glossary. Arnold covers a wide breadth of information in a clear, concise, and fun way that is sure to please the intended audience. Some may find fault with the author's failure to mention white-nose syndrome, which has killed more than five million bats in North America since 2006.

They do however tell in great detail of the carnage that took place on the islands during Columbus? reign.

This is not a soft-on-crime, feel-good philosophy, but rather a concrete effort to bring justice and healing to everyone involved in a crime. Circle processes draw from the Native American tradition of gathering in a circle to solve problems as a community. Peacemaking circles are used in neighborhoods, in schools, in the workplace, and in social services to support victims of all kinds, resolve behavior problems, and create positive climates.<br><br> Each book is written by a scholar at the forefront of these movements, making this important reading for classrooms, community leaders, and anyone involved with conflict resolution.</p><p><b>Howard Zehr</b> directed the first victim offender conferencing program in the US and is one of the original developers of restorative justice as a concept.

Wells housing project. Set against the stunning photographs of a talented young photographer from the projects, <i>Our America</i> evokes the unforgiving world of these two amazing young men, and their struggle to survive unrelenting tragedy. With a gift for clear-eyed journalism, they tell their own stories and others, including that of the death of Eric Morse, a five-year-old who was dropped to his death from the fourteenth floor of an Ida B. Wells apartment building by two other little boys. <br> Sometimes funny, often painful, but always charged with their dream of <i>Our America,</i> LeAlan Jones and Lloyd Newman reach out to grab your attention and break your heart.</p><p>This heartbreaking and inspiring book goes a long way toward fulfilling the wish one of its authors, LeAlan Jones, makes in his epigraph: "You must learn our America as we must learn your America, so that, maybe, someday, we can become one." Based on hours and hours of taped interviews that Jones and Lloyd Newman, two high school students, conducted for two National Public Radio documentaries they prepared in 1993 and 1995, <i>Our America</i> is a no-holds-barred look at the devastatingly poor Chicago neighborhood in which they live. It's a world where elementary school students learn about sex and drugs before they learn how to read, and where many boys do not expect to live to be 20. You finish the book marveling not that so many of those who people it are trapped, but wondering that anyone survives at all.Every once in a while, voices emerge from a part of the world that we have forgotten or chosen to ignore.

In the tradition of <i>The Diary of Anne Frank</i> and <i>Zlata's Diary</i>, <i>Our America</i> reaches out, to grab your attention and break your heart. </p><p><b>Author's Note</b> </p><p>Our America was edited from more than a hundred hours of tape recorded by LeAlan and Lloyd.

All references to gangs and gang members have been omitted for the safety of LeAlan, Lloyd, and their families. </p><p>LeAlan did most of the talking on the tapes from which this book | \\ was written (he is an extraordinarily gifted speaker), with Lloyd listening hard by his side, curious and admiring, every so often tossing in a wide-eyed question or comment.

It can also activate or relax muscles, depending on its application.

Some of our favorite things include flying near the stars in the night sky, having glitter tea parties with my bat-patterned tea set, and practicing our ballet. <br> We have been practicing our ballet a lot recently and putting on shows for Mom and Dad. I have discovered that Dad&#x2019;s vampire cape makes a great stage curtain! It looks especially nice with silver-star sequins glued onto it . . . though I am not sure Dad agrees. He seemed a little . . . annoyed last time he saw his best cape being used as a stage curtain. <br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s covered in stars!&#x201d; he complained. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a wizard&#x2014;I&#x2019;m a vampire! Vampires don&#x2019;t have starry capes.&#x201d; <br> I felt bad then, but it was okay because Mom waved her wand, and the stars all disappeared. She can do things like that because she&#x2019;s a fairy. She was the one who brought Pink Rabbit to life for me. <br> &#x201c;Good as new!&#x201d; she said, sitting down on one of the chairs Pink Rabbit and I had put out for the audience. Dad sat down too, with my baby sister, Honeyblossom, on his lap, and they all waited for our show to begin. <br> &#x201c;Right,&#x201d; I whispered to Pink Rabbit once we were behind the non-starry curtain. &#x201c;Can you remember your moves?&#x201d; <br> Pink Rabbit nodded and did a perfect leap. He&#x2019;s been getting very good at ballet lately. I gave him a thumbs-up. <br> &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go!&#x201d; I whispered. <br> Together we leapt out from behind the curtain in a magnificent jump. Mom and Dad clapped and cheered. Pink Rabbit began to twirl on his tippy-toes. I swirled and twirled in my glittering black tutu. <br> &#x201c;Excellent!&#x201d; called Dad. <br> &#x201c;Enchanting!&#x201d; said Mom, waving her wand so that we were showered with pink flower petals. <br> At the end of the show, I gave a deep curtsy and Pink Rabbit bowed, and Mom and Dad cheered some more. Even Honeyblossom clapped her chubby little hands. <br> &#x201c;That was really wonderful!&#x201d; said Mom. &#x201c;And so professional!&#x201d; <br> Pink Rabbit looked proud and puffed out his chest in his striped waistcoat. <br> &#x201c;One day you&#x2019;ll both be prima ballerinas!&#x201d; said Dad. <br> &#x201c;I hope so!&#x201d; I said as we both tiptoed gracefully across the floor. We followed Mom and Dad down the stairs and into the kitchen for breakfast. It was seven o&#x2019;clock at night, but we always have two breakfasts in our house. One in the morning and one in the evening. That is because Dad sleeps during the day. He has his breakfast in the evening, before going out for his nightly fly. <br> &#x201c;I want to be just like Tatiana Tutu!&#x201d; I said as I began to spread peanut butter on a piece of toast. Tatiana Tutu is my favorite ballerina of all time. <br> I have never seen her in real life, but I always watch when she&#x2019;s on TV, and I have a special scrapbook filled with pictures of her. I cut the pictures out of magazines and decorate them with starry sequins and silver glitter. <br> I also have a big poster of Tatiana Tutu on my bedroom wall. She is wearing a sparkling black tutu and her famous star diamond tiara. Her black tutu looks exactly like the kind a vampire-fairy might wear. . . .

But as readers will see in this first-ever illustrated picture book about Nadia&#x2019;s journey to Olympic gold, the road from small-town girl to world-class athlete was full of many imperfect moments.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expert illustrations that capture the energy and fluidity of Nadia's exuberant gymnastic routines and referential back matter round out this inspirational story of determination and overcoming adversity. A perfect 10.</p><p>As a little girl, Karlin Gray loved gymnastics but she wasn't feisty, fearless, or focused like Nadia Comaneci. Karlin had no problem sitting still . . . daydreaming and, eventually, writing. After working several years in publishing, she sat down and wrote her first picture book, <i>Nadia: The Girl Who Couldn&#x2019;t Sit Still.</i> Karlin lives in Connecticut with her husband, son, and a very bouncy dog.<br><br>Christine Davenier lives in Paris. She has also illustrated the <i>Very Fairy Princess</i> books by actress Julie Andrews and her daughter Emma Walton Hamilton. &nbsp;&nbsp;K-Gr 3&#x2014;This picture book biography of Olympic gold medalist Nadia Comaneci draws information from accounts written by Comaneci and her coach Bela Karolyi, as well as other sources, to present a somewhat idealized story of a lively little girl who became a champion. Climbing trees, roller skating, biking&#x2014;Nadia is in constant movement until her mother lands upon the idea of signing her up for gymnastics lessons. Her ability at age six catches the attention of Karolyi, who, with his wife Marta, runs a gymnastics school. The text describes the dedication and years of practice that were required of Nadia, including even difficult moments, such as her 13th-place ranking at her first Romanian Junior National Championships competition. But the cheerful illustrations, rendered in ecoline and colored ink, with colored pencil accents, maintain a buoyant tone throughout. The pictures include a lot of energy, showing Nadia as upbeat and determined. If Comaneci suffered along her road to the Olympics, those details are left out. Several pages are devoted to her record-breaking performances at the 1976 Olympics. A brief afterword fills in later parts of her life, such as winning more medals at the 1980 Olympics and defecting from Romania in 1989. VERDICT Based on the popularity of gymnastics in the United States and this year's upcoming summer Olympics, this book will find a ready audience.&#x2014;Lucinda Snyder Whitehurst, St. Christopher's School, Richmond, VA</p><h2>Trouble Talk</h2><p>Maya's friend Bailey loves to talk about everything and everyone.

When spirited redhead Molly Murphy was growing up a peasant on the coast of Ireland she always imagined there was something more in store for her. She couldn't have known how right she was until the day she became a murderer, albeit in self-defense. Under drastic circumstances, Molly is forced to strike out into a new world. With the police right behind her, Molly's only chance at escape is a false identity and a steamship that will take her far, far away: to America. </p><p>When her ship sails into New York Harbor, with the majestic figure of the Statue of Liberty providing comfort and inspiration, Molly is sure her whole life is in front of her. But she's got one last hurdle to clear: Ellis Island. She is just one among thousands of immigrants on the tiny island, awaiting their fate with anxiety and hope. Unfortunately for Molly, before she is able to leave the island a man is brutally murdered, his throat cut from ear to ear, and coincidence and fate make her a suspect in a crime she didn't commit. Under a cloud of suspicion, and due largely to a growing mutual attraction between Molly and the handsome police captain in charge of the case, she is allowed to leave Ellis Island for Manhattan. Unfortunately, she's got a mission she couldn't have anticipated: clear her own name of murder. Alone in a new country with no one to lean on, Molly hits the vibrant streets of New York intent on finding out what really happened. After all, if she can't, she'll be sent back to Ireland, where the dreaded gallows await. </p><p>With the sweeping skyline of 19th century New York and the gritty, pulsating underworld of recently arrived immigrants forming a vivid backdrop, Rhys Bowen transports readers back in time to America's not-so-distant past. The first entry in the Molly Murphy series is a fascinating look at our immigrant history as well as an intensely absorbing page-turner.</p></p><p>RHYS BOWEN is the author of the Anthony and Agatha Award&#x2013;winning Molly Murphy mysteries, the Edgar Award-nominated Evan Evans series, <i>In Farleigh Field, </i>and the Royal Spyness series.

Only in this way can students free themselves from the constraints of tradition and find their own imaginative paths. However, it is vital that students first have a solid grasp of classical perspective before they can think about adapting it creatively.<br>In presenting the principles of perspective drawing, Mr. Watson devotes a chapter each to step-by-step discussions of such topics as the picture plane, foreshortening and convergence, the circle, the cone, three-point perspective, universal perspective, figures in perspective, and much more. To illustrate his points he offers expert analysis of the works of such leading illustrators as John Atherton, V. Bobri, R. M. Chapin, Jr., Albert Dorne, Robert Fawcett, Constantin Guys, W. N. Hudson, Carl Roberts, Ben Stahl, and Aldren A. Watson, as well as drawings by Pieter de Hooch and Paul C�zanne. The result is a ground-breaking study that artists, illustrators, and draftsmen will find invaluable in learning to create works with convincing perspective.<br>Ernest W. Watson taught at Pratt Institute for over 20 years, co-founded and served as editor-in-chief of the magazine <i>American Artist,</i> and co-founded the prestigious art publishing house of Watson-Guptill.</p><p></p><h2>The Secret Zoo: Raids and Rescues (Secret Zoo, 5)</h2><p><p>The fifth book in the fast-paced and imaginative series about four adventurous friends and the secret world hidden in their local zoo.

The pacing and feelings ring true in this heartwarming depiction of someone accustomed to being the center of his universe but who responds to the impulse of hospitality and friendship." <br> - Kirkus Reviews<br><br>In this quiet story by Dubuc (Up the Mountain Path), the unidentified creature who appears in front of squirrel Otto's tree trunk dwelling isn't just uninvited, he's inconvenient... Slowly, Otto realizes that Pio is generous and helpful. And when Pio rescues him from a frightening predator, he decides that it might be worth making room to accommodate his new friend.

Soon he finds himself chasing a killer whose horrific crime could have implications far afield in a Europe threatened by the rise of Hitler. A riveting, atmospheric, multilayered mystery, this intense and intelligent tale more than delivers on the promise of Rennie Airth's first thriller.</p><p>Rennie Airth's first John Madden historical thriller, <i>River of Darkness</i>, found a place on more than a few "best of the year" lists in 1999--with good reason. Set in post-World War I England, it was serial-killer fiction of an unusually exalted order, with Madden, then a taciturn and wearily pragmatic veteran-turned-Scotland Yard inspector, investigating the eerie slaughter of a well-respected family in Surrey.<p> Fortunately, Airth's first sequel was worth the six-year wait. <i>The Blood-Dimmed Tide</i> (which takes its title from a W.B. Yeats poem) finds Madden now retired and living peacefully on a farm in Surrey with his doctor wife, the former Helen Blackwell, and their two children, 10-year-old Rob and 6-year-old Lucy. The year is 1932, and the precipitous rise of the Nazis in Germany leaves many of their fellow countrymen, as well as no few Brits, worried for the future peace and stability of the European continent. More immediately concerning for Madden, however, is his discovery of the corpse of pubescent Alice Bridger--raped, disfigured, and secreted near a tramps' backwoods campsite. Suspicion falls quickly on a vagrant known as Beezy, who was supposedly visiting the area, but Madden--with his remarkable insight into crime ("Madden's always had a way of seeing things clearly, of seeing through them, or rather beyond them," relates a former police colleague)--thinks this is more than an isolated homicide. Sure enough, a records check turns up similar slayings elsewhere in England, dating back to 1929, as well as an active investigation by German law enforcement into half a dozen dead girls in Bavaria and Prussia. What accounts for both the wide range of these mutilations, and the lengthy lag time between them? Could the police be looking for a psychopathic traveler, or worse, a rogue spy who's managed to maintain a respectable front at his international postings, while satisfying his malevolent appetites in his spare hours? And what is the "devil&#x2019;s mark" that this killer reportedly bears?</p><p> Airth is a fastidious plotter, expert in trickling out twists that heighten story tension but don't leave readers awash in red herrings. Although Madden's role here is somewhat less than it was in <i>River of Darkness</i>--a consequence of his strong-willed wife trying to protect him from further hurt, after the horrendous events of that previous tale--the author compensates by giving us a supporting cast of amply dimensioned Yard types, led by Chief Inspector Angus Sinclair, a perceptive Scot whose doggedness pairs well with Madden's gift for inspiration. While Airth fails, oddly, to exploit a couple of opportunities for interesting plot turns at book's end, his psychological portrait of the murderer imbues <i>Tide</i> with a fine pathos, and the backdrop of Nazi power-grabbing sets the stage for what is supposed to be a third and final Madden yarn. Let&#x2019;s hope that novel appears in more expeditious fashion. <i>--J.

But on the advent of that fateful birthday, she realized that her golden years had been full of unforeseen pleasures. Now, the astute and ever-insightful Heilbrun muses on the emotional and intellectual insights that brought her "to choose each day for now, to live." There are reflections on her new house and her sturdy, comfortable marriage; sweet solitude and the pleasures of sex at an advanced age; the fascination with e-mail and the joy of discovering unexpected friends. Even the encroachments of loss, pain, and sadness that come with age cannot spoil Heilbrun's moveable feast. They are merely the price of bountiful living.</p><p>Years ago Carolyn Heilbrun, a long-time feminist (<i>Writing a Woman's Life</i>) who also writes mysteries as Amanda Cross (<i>The James Joyce Murder</i>), decided to leave before age dragged her down by committing suicide at 70. Fortunately, she reneged, and chose instead to chronicle moments from her 60s. Always erudite, often deliciously wry, if sometimes pretentious, Heilbrun hits the mark more often than not in this book of essays. She speaks of "unmet friends" whose lives have paralleled her own and blessed deliverance from the academic bustle and backstabbing of Columbia University, the tyranny of memory, and foolish feminine clothes. Throughout, her sense of renewal is as welcome as her determination to go against the grain.As a young woman, Carolyn Heilbrun made a resolution not to live past "three score years and ten." Taking her own life at the age of seventy, she reasoned, would lend clean closure to a life well lived, and would keep her from the many tragedies of aging--becoming a burden to her children, witnessing the deterioration of her body, falling prey to a crippling disease. But on the advent of her seventieth birthday, she looked back on the past ten years and found, to her surprise, that her sixties had been the happiest decade of all: after fifty years, her marriage had matured into a happy balance of companionship and respect for solitude; she had developed deep friendships with her grown children and a small circle of peers; she had mastered a highly successful career as a scholar and writer. In the poignant, essayistic writing that best showcases her elegant talent and provocative mind, Carolyn Heilbrun celebrates the many pleasures of a mature life.<p></p><p>Filled with wisdom, knowledge, wry humor, and literary allusion, <i>The Last Gift of Time</i> is a moving book for all women invested in the pursuit of leading a woman's life to its fullest capacity.</p></p><h2>Dreams: A Way to Listen to God</h2><p>A basic introduction to the interpretation of dreams, providing guidelines for understanding their spiritual significance.</p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Complete Guide to Home Canning and Preserving</h2><p>Practical, easy-to-follow guide contains virtually everything consumers need to know about home canning: how to select, prepare, and can fruits, vegetables, poultry, red meats and seafoods; how to preserve fruit spreads, fermented foods, and pickled vegetables; how to prepare foods for special diets, and much more.</p><p>This practical, easy-to-follow-guide&#x2014;newly revised and updated&#x2014;offers food shoppers an attractive, high-quality alternative to high-priced, overprocessed, and undernourishing foods.

I&#x2019;m two sentences into a sixty-thousand-word book that I think I need to write because my manager, Norm, says my career won&#x2019;t really take off until I have a book. I got a deal from a huge publisher because they saw me perform and loved how I was able to walk onstage and speak my absolute truth to a crowd of strangers while making them laugh at the same time. I signed the deal and everything was going great until they said, &#x201c;Okay, now write a book.&#x201d;<br> <br>If you think I wrote that because it&#x2019;s a funny way to start a book, you&#x2019;re wrong. Right now I&#x2019;m in a battle with my mind, which is trying to do everything it can to stop me from writing so it can escape the pain I feel in my chest as I type. My mind is trying to tell me that I don&#x2019;t know how to do this. It&#x2019;s telling me that this book is going to suck. It&#x2019;s telling me I&#x2019;m going to miss my deadline and reminding me of a Facebook comment where someone said my vocabulary was atrocious, and once I understood what that meant, I was really hurt. The thought that I have to write this book with the English skills of a twelve-year-old has been standing between me and my happiness for the last six months.<br> <br>So far, I&#x2019;ve started this book about a dozen times. I tried writing with cowriters, I tried writing alone, I tried writing in restaurants, I tried going to a cabin in Monterey. I almost tried not writing the book at all. I basically forgot everything I&#x2019;ve ever discovered about creativity and let how I was going to write this book get in the way of why I&#x2019;m writing this book, which I&#x2019;m in the process of figuring out.<br><br>Here&#x2019;s a picture of me as I try to write this. As you can see by how high my hair is, I&#x2019;m having a hard time.<br><br> <br><br>And now I&#x2019;m thinking about you. You spent twenty bucks, hopefully thirty, on this book with the hope that it would help you in some way, and the first page is just about how scared I am to write it. I&#x2019;m sorry, the only thing I know how to do is say exactly what&#x2019;s on my mind. I know that might sound strange, but what&#x2019;s stranger to me is the fact that most people don&#x2019;t say what&#x2019;s actually on their minds. We&#x2019;re always thinking something, but instead of saying what we&#x2019;re really thinking, which would free us and open us up to new possibilities, we instead say what we think people want to hear. How much easier would life be if we just said what we were thinking in the moment?<br> <br>You would have sensed my inauthenticity immediately if I was feeling fear in every ounce of my body and I just overlooked it in order to write the &#x201c;right&#x201d; thing. Instead, by baring my soul and telling you what I&#x2019;m actually experiencing, I&#x2019;m freeing myself from the pain I would otherwise be hiding and holding on to. Something I&#x2019;ve learned is that sharing my deepest truth, no matter how scary it is in the moment, is freedom. My only pain would come from repressing that truth.<br> <br>For instance, if a man were to get in an elevator and there was a beautiful woman next to him, he might be trying to think of something to say to her to open up a conversation. What if he just said that? What if he turned to the woman and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m trying to think of the right thing to say to you.&#x201d; Think of how honest, vulnerable, and freeing that would be. Instead of hiding behind some cheesy pickup line, he gives her his heart, his fears, his truth, and he opens up the possibility for her to do the same. Wouldn&#x2019;t it be attractive if someone started a conversation with that level of authenticity? It brings out a mystery, it opens your mind, it speaks to your heart. It&#x2019;s not a corny line; it&#x2019;s actually true. It gives you the opportunity to respond because now you&#x2019;re playing catch with a possibility. You could respond with &#x201c;Well, you could start out by talking about how nice my hair is.&#x201d; So now you have a conversation that&#x2019;s playful and freeing you from your fears because you&#x2019;re taking your truth and putting it out there.<br> <br>Most people don&#x2019;t do that though. Most people get on the elevator and see the attractive person and go, &#x201c;It sure is weather outside today.&#x201d; And then the other person goes, &#x201c;Yes, and there was weather yesterday too.&#x201d; Now both of them aren&#x2019;t speaking from their hearts. They&#x2019;re speaking from a place of strategy because they&#x2019;re trying to get something from each other. They&#x2019;re not being real with their feelings; they&#x2019;re salesmen. You would never look in the mirror and say to yourself, &#x201c;The weather is nice.&#x201d; You would talk about your fears and what is really going on at the deepest level. When you&#x2019;re totally honest and transparent about what you&#x2019;re thinking, you free yourself from it.<br> <br>So I guess what I&#x2019;m hoping for here is that whoever might be reading this will be able to connect to me and what I&#x2019;m experiencing if I just share exactly what I&#x2019;m going through. I know you may not necessarily be in the middle of trying to write a book, but you might be able to connect on the idea that I feel like I need to do something a certain way to make someone else happy. Have you ever felt that way? Have you felt that you had to do something that wasn&#x2019;t what you really wanted to do, just to get love or approval from a friend, a teacher, a boss, a spouse, a parent? Do you know what I mean? Can you feel me? ARE YOU THERE?<br> <br>See? This is why I do better with audiences. I have no idea who the hell is reading this and how you&#x2019;re reacting. I guess that&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m in so much fear right now. Like most people, I&#x2019;ve been trained to try to make everyone around me happy so I can feel loved by them. I was trained to do that so well that I did it professionally as a national touring comedian for twenty years. By writing this book, I&#x2019;m actually learning how much I&#x2019;ve been addicted to other people&#x2019;s opinions of me. This is both scary and exciting. It&#x2019;s scary to realize that, but it&#x2019;s exciting to uncover something that I never knew about myself before. I&#x2019;m doing exactly the same thing I do when I&#x2019;m onstage, but because I don&#x2019;t see you nodding and laughing, it makes me think I&#x2019;m not doing a good job and I won&#x2019;t be loved. I guess that&#x2019;s what is really happening here and why I&#x2019;ve had such a hard time starting this. I&#x2019;m trying to make my manager, my publisher (Hi, Michele, do you like it?), and everyone else happy instead of connecting to why I&#x2019;m really writing this book.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m not writing it for any of them, and to be honest, I&#x2019;m not even doing this for you. This might seem like a book that I made for you, but the reality is that you are the muse for me as I continually evolve into my soul. I know I have to write this book because my experience has shown me that if I&#x2019;m in this much pain, then there is something really important that I need to learn. I&#x2019;ve had many times where I really felt like bailing on something that I was afraid of, but when I stuck with it, it caused me to grow internally and turned out to be the greatest decision I ever made. I know that as I stay in the room and begin to just accept all these fears and emotions, I&#x2019;ll begin to transcend my addiction to &#x201c;doing a good job&#x201d; and move into a version of myself that is freer than I have ever been.<br> <br>Maybe you&#x2019;re in pain too. Maybe that&#x2019;s why you picked up this book. Maybe hearing someone face the deepest truth in themselves will awaken something in you, and you will be able to access a new level of freedom too&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but the moment I take that into consideration, I won&#x2019;t be giving my gift to its fullest. Why? Because I&#x2019;ll be thinking more about what you want and how to make my audience happy than truly allowing whatever words want to come through. I just have to surrender to whatever results come out of that place so I can truly tap into the edge of my creation. This book will be much better if I let go of any outcome.<br> <br>Think of an apple tree. An apple tree is just here to make apples. Apple trees don&#x2019;t care if we like their apples or not. They don&#x2019;t care if we make apple juice, applesauce, or apple mayonnaise with their apples. Apple trees aren&#x2019;t ever thinking, &#x201c;How many apples will I sell?&#x201d; or &#x201c;What will I get for these apples?&#x201d; If they did care, they&#x2019;d be so caught up worrying about the endless number of things that could happen to their apples that it would stifle their ability to make them. Even though there is a part of me that doesn&#x2019;t recommend that you make mayonnaise out of this book, I know I need to release myself from what you do with this information. I&#x2019;m just here to make apples. Maybe by releasing any expectation of an outcome, I might be able to make ten times as many apples that taste even better because I&#x2019;m slipping out of &#x201c;What do I get?&#x201d; and moving into &#x201c;What am I here to share?&#x201d; (or, if you want to go deeper: &#x201c;What is trying to express itself through me?&#x201d;).<br> <br>If I&#x2019;m writing this to make anyone else happy outside of myself, then I&#x2019;ll be capped at the level of their expectation and miss out on the infinite amount of creativity and unknown possibilities that could come from this. Anyone who has made a true impact on this planet, at one point, had to step out of the expectation of the people around them and listen to an inner calling that moved them into a place of originality beyond what they had done before. Like that point, for example&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that just made so much sense to me and unlocked something inside of myself, and I have never said it before. If I had just started writing a typical self-help book with a bunch of great concepts instead of sharing the actual pain I was experiencing, I never would have written that sentence. Man, that sentence was good. Well, looks like we&#x2019;re done here. How many words is that so far? Crap, it&#x2019;s only 1,839. It truly felt to me like 22,910. I thought for sure I was almost done. This is insane, what am I doing???<br> <br>Okay, well, I guess I can look at what&#x2019;s happened so far and realize this has already gotten a little easier. My body is letting go of some of the tension that was making this so difficult and I already know a little more than I did when I started, so by the end of this I&#x2019;ll probably be totally on fire and will have an entirely new level of awareness to share with you. If it&#x2019;s only been an hour since I started, then what might happen ten hours from now? Now my emotions are moving from 100 percent fear to, let&#x2019;s say, 50 percent fear, 49 percent excitement, and 1 percent horny. I&#x2019;m kind of getting aroused by my work. But only 1 percent, so don&#x2019;t bother coming over. I have to get up early anyway.<br> <br>Any time we start something creative, it&#x2019;s kind of like turning on a garden hose for the first time in a while. The water that comes out first is dirty and gross, but once that&#x2019;s out of the way, what comes next is some sweet, sweet, garden-hose tap water. So all I&#x2019;ve done so far is start to get that dirty water moving to make way for some delicious garden-hose water. I think I made that analogy confusing, because halfway through I realized that garden-hose tap water is still not good water. A more accurate analogy would be that hopefully this book is going to start as dirty garden-hose water and end up as crystal-clear Himalayan springwater that frees you from your mind prison.<br> <br>Okay, now I&#x2019;m starting to have fun and these pages are starting to turn into a playground. I&#x2019;m slowly starting to slip out of the self-imposed rules I had put on what this book is supposed to be and what is acceptable for a book about transformation. I had in my head a vision of what the book should look like that wasn&#x2019;t coming from my heart, it was coming from a mental projection of what I thought was expected of me. I started thinking that it had to be like all the other books, which would actually stop me from being original. Now that I feel like I&#x2019;m stepping out of that cage, I&#x2019;m seeing all sorts of possibilities for where this could go. Like maybe one chapter could be a scratch-and-sniff chapter. Okay, bad example, but the point is, the doors are opening and ideas are starting to come through. There is still fear for sure though, like after I came up with that scratch-and-sniff idea, my mind was like, &#x201c;That is so stupid, words don&#x2019;t have smells.&#x201d; But now I&#x2019;m telling you about that thought, so I&#x2019;m free again!<br> <br>PS: I just thought of a word that has a smell. The word is &#x201c;moisture.&#x201d; What do you think that word smells like? My friend Dan says, &#x201c;Moldy sponge.&#x201d; I say, &#x201c;Rotten orange.&#x201d; But it turns out the word &#x201c;moisture&#x201d; smells like fresh waffles with motor oil and leaves.<br> <br>I just realized that I don&#x2019;t even know why I think writing sixty thousand words is such a big deal. Hold on, I&#x2019;m going to Google how many words we usually speak in an hour. Holy crap. (Thanks for holding, by the way.) I found out we would average somewhere between ten thousand and twelve thousand words per hour if we talked nonstop. That&#x2019;s really exciting to me because I do events where I speak onstage for two days straight. I literally walk onstage without any idea what I&#x2019;m going to say and then speak from my heart for like eight hours a day, both days. The only preparation I do is to relax and play in every moment leading up to the event so that when I&#x2019;m onstage, the only difference is I&#x2019;m three feet higher. If I can talk for two entire days in front of thousands of people, this is nothing.<br> <br>What I feel happening now is that my mind is starting to get evidence that it&#x2019;s not going to die from doing something that it hasn&#x2019;t done before and is starting to get on the same page as the creative, apple-tree part of me that wants to express itself. Now I&#x2019;m at 62 percent excited, 35 percent scared, and 3 percent horny, so let&#x2019;s play tonight by ear. I can feel my mind piling on all the reasons why this is going to be fun and easy instead of giving me evidence of why I&#x2019;m a terrible person with an elementary school child&#x2019;s vocabulary. That would be scrampulent. (Just because I don&#x2019;t know all of the words, that doesn&#x2019;t mean I can&#x2019;t make words up.) It wouldn&#x2019;t only be scrampulent, it would be markoviltly scrampulent.<br> <br>The moment that we do the thing is when we learn how to do the thing. I feel like I read that somewhere or have said it before or something, or maybe I just saw it on a bumper sticker. I wonder if it&#x2019;s plagiarism if I spend a paragraph debating on whether I wrote it or not. Anyway, I think it fit the moment, so I&#x2019;ll keep it for now and ask my editor later. If you&#x2019;re reading this, that means either that I actually did come up with it or that plagiarism is fine if you question it right after.<br> <br>Where was I? Oh yeah, I was going to say our minds are always trying to figure out how something is going to go, but they can only project what will happen in the future based off of what&#x2019;s happened in the past. Almost all of us see ourselves as our past stories. We believe that our identities are contained within the boundaries of what we&#x2019;ve accomplished, what we&#x2019;ve failed to accomplish, what we&#x2019;ve looked like, what we&#x2019;ve learned, etc. Anything outside of what we&#x2019;ve experienced before is threatening to the identities we&#x2019;ve had our entire lives.<br> <br>From speaking on thousands and thousands of stages, changing careers from a successful stand-up comedian to an unknown transformational speaker, and constantly making leaps that seem really scary, I&#x2019;ve learned that when we haven&#x2019;t done something before, our minds are under the illusion that we can&#x2019;t, so they&#x2019;re horrified that we&#x2019;re moving beyond the story they have built to protect us. Can you feel what I mean by that? Here&#x2019;s an example: If you think &#x201c;who you are&#x201d; is someone who makes $20,000 a year and then someone offers you a million dollars, then...</p><h2>Mansions of Madness (Call of Cthulhu Horror Roleplaying, 1920s Era)</h2><p>MANSIONS OF MADNESS is a collection of six independent tales for Call of Cthulhu.

Foster shows that Harper's work took on a national scope, focusing on race and gender equality, temperance, and Christian reform, and that these themes intensified as she continued writing well after the emancipation. Harper was the most popular African-American poet of her time; the first paid black abolitionist lecturer and short story writer; the first to experiment with dialect in the speech of her characters to express the sensibilities of the oppressed (a technique usually credited to the younger Dunbar); and the first to develop heroic black characters. Foster maintains that the nation's racist reaction to emancipation and sexist reaction to the woman's movement at the turn of the century resulted in Harper's absence from the literary canon.

These five statements summarize much of what the Reformation was about, and they distinguish Protestantism from other expressions of the Christian faith. Protestants place ultimate and final authority in the Scriptures, acknowledge the work of Christ alone as sufficient for redemption, recognize that salvation is by grace alone through faith alone, and seek to do all things for God&#x2019;s glory.</p><p>In <em>God&#x2019;s Glory Alone</em><em>&#x2014;The Majestic Heart of Christian Faith and Life</em>, renowned scholar David VanDrunen looks at the historical and biblical roots of the idea that all glory belongs to God alone. He examines the development of this theme in the Reformation, in subsequent Reformed theology and confessions, and in contemporary theologians who continue to be inspired by the conviction that all glory belongs to God. Then he turns to the biblical story of God's glory, beginning with the pillar of cloud and fire revealed to Israel, continuing through the incarnation, death, and exaltation of the Lord Jesus Christ, and culminating in Christ's Second Coming and the glorification of his people. In light of these wonderful biblical themes he concludes by addressing several of today's great cultural challenges and temptations&#x2014;such as distraction and narcissism&#x2014;and reflecting on how commitment to God's glory alone fortifies us to live godly lives in this present evil age.</p></p><p><p>David VanDrunen (JD, Northwestern University School of Law; PhD Loyola University Chicago) is Robert B.

As politicians, public intellectuals, and poets they struggled to transform imperial France into a democratic federation, with former colonies as autonomous members of a transcontinental polity. In so doing, they revitalized past but unrealized political projects and anticipated impossible futures by acting as if they had already arrived. Refusing to reduce colonial emancipation to national independence, they regarded decolonization as an opportunity to remake the world, reconcile peoples, and realize humanity&#x2019;s potential. Emphasizing the link between politics and aesthetics, Gary Wilder reads C�saire and Senghor as pragmatic utopians, situated humanists, and concrete cosmopolitans whose postwar insights can illuminate current debates about self-management, postnational politics, and planetary solidarity. <i>Freedom Time</i> invites scholars to decolonize intellectual history and globalize critical theory, to analyze the temporal dimensions of political life, and to question the territorialist assumptions of contemporary historiography.</p><p>Gary Wilder is Associate Professor of Anthropology at The Graduate Center of the City University of New York.&nbsp; He is the author of <i>The French Imperial Nation-State: Negritude and Colonial Humanism between the Two World Wars</i>."<i>Freedom Time</i> is an important book. It is also exceptionally scholarly and extremely readable. Such qualities rarely inhere in a single text.

Wilder observes that C�saire, S�dar and their contemporaries in black Caribbean and African thought &#x2018;are rarely included in general considerations of interwar philosophy or postwar social theory&#x2019; (9). What <i>Freedom Time </i>does most convincingly is to demonstrate that the social theory studied in European universities is weaker for this omission and that serious engagement with these thinkers is long overdue."&nbsp; -- Lucy Mayblin, <i>Ethnic and Racial Studies</i> Published On: 2015-10-14<br><br>"[A] thoughtful and challenging work on the often maligned Negritude thinkers, poets, and politicians Aim� C�saire and L�opold Senghor."&nbsp; -- Brett A.

Parker&#39;s inimitable private investigator Spenser has been solving cases and selling millions of books worldwide. Now, for the first time, see how it all began as the Mystery Writers of America Grand Master sheds light on Spenser&#39;s formative years spent with his father and two uncles out West. This is an event book for every fan of Spenser, and a revelation for teens about to discover an American icon.</p><p>Robert B. Parker lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.Grade 7 Up&#x2014;Parker's well-known detective hero, Spenser, reminisces to his beloved wife, Susan, about his Western childhood and workingman values bestowed upon him by his father and two uncles. The flashbacks derive from the lad's motherless household, in which Spenser is encouraged to throw punches at his uncles, who were accomplished boxers, and to learn how to defend himself against bullies. In another memory, young Spenser comes face to face with an angry black bear while bird hunting and stands his ground, though he is ultimately saved by his father's more powerful gun. This incident mentally prepares him for the dramatic tracking and rescue of a friend who was abducted by her abusive and alcoholic father. Parker's portrayal of Spenser's bravado in facing the bowie knife-wielding individual and escaping downriver is a compelling page-turner, and the man's demise shocking. This glimpse into the past explains much of the adult Spenser's backbone, though the stop-and-reflect method of storytelling may appeal more to adults than to teens who like their action uninterrupted, such as in his <i>Edenville Owls</i> (Philomel, 2007). Parker's dialogue-driven style and spare vocabulary are comparable to Gary Paulsen's <i>The Beet Fields</i> (Delacorte, 2000).&#x2014;<i>Vicki Reutter, Cazenovia High School, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Ever since I was assigned Strunk and White&#x2019;s <i>The Elements of Style</i> in an introductory psychology course, the writing guide has been among my favorite literary genres. It&#x2019;s not just that I welcome advice on the lifelong challenge of perfecting the craft of writing. It&#x2019;s also that credible guidance on writing must itself be well written, and the best of the manuals are paragons of their own advice. William Strunk&#x2019;s course notes on writing, which his student E. B. White turned into their famous little book, was studded with gems of self-exemplification such as &#x201c;Write with nouns and verbs,&#x201d; &#x201c;Put the emphatic words of a sentence at the end,&#x201d; and best of all, his prime directive, &#x201c;Omit needless words.&#x201d; Many eminent stylists have applied their gifts to explaining the art, including Kingsley Amis, Jacques Barzun, Ambrose Bierce, Bill Bryson, Robert Graves, Tracy Kidder, Stephen King, Elmore Leonard, F. L. Lucas, George Orwell, William Safire, and of course White himself, the beloved author of <i>Charlotte&#x2019;s Web</i> and <i>Stuart Little.</i> Here is the great essayist reminiscing about his teacher:</p><p>I like to read style manuals for another reason, the one that sends botanists to the garden and chemists to the kitchen: it&#x2019;s a practical application of our science. I am a psycholinguist and a cognitive scientist, and what is style, after all, but the effective use of words to engage the human mind? It&#x2019;s all the more captivating to someone who seeks to explain these fields to a wide readership. I think about how language works so that I can best explain how language works.</p><p>But my professional acquaintance with language has led me to read the traditional manuals with a growing sense of unease. Strunk and White, for all their intuitive feel for style, had a tenuous grasp of grammar.2 They misdefined terms such as <i>phrase, participle,</i> and <i>relative clause, </i>and in steering their readers away from passive verbs and toward active transitive ones they botched their examples of both. <i>There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground,</i> for instance, is not in the passive voice, nor does <i>The cock&#x2019;s crow came with dawn</i> contain a transitive verb. Lacking the tools to analyze language, they often struggled when turning their intuitions into advice, vainly appealing to the writer&#x2019;s &#x201c;ear.&#x201d; And they did not seem to realize that some of the advice contradicted itself: &#x201c;Many a tame sentence&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. can be made lively and emphatic by substituting a transitive in the active voice&#x201d; uses the passive voice to warn against the passive voice. George Orwell, in his vaunted &#x201c;Politics and the English Language,&#x201d; fell into the same trap when, without irony, he derided prose in which &#x201c;the passive voice is wherever possible used in preference to the active.&#x201d;3</p><p>Self-contradiction aside, we now know that telling writers to avoid the passive is bad advice. Linguistic research has shown that the passive construction has a number of indispensable functions because of the way it engages a reader&#x2019;s attention and memory. A skilled writer should know what those functions are and push back against copy editors who, under the influence of grammatically na�ve style guides, blue-pencil every passive construction they spot into an active one.</p><p>Style manuals that are innocent of linguistics also are crippled in dealing with the aspect of writing that evokes the most emotion: correct and incorrect usage. Many style manuals treat traditional rules of usage the way fundamentalists treat the Ten Commandments: as unerring laws chiseled in sapphire for mortals to obey or risk eternal damnation. But skeptics and freethinkers who probe the history of these rules have found that they belong to an oral tradition of folklore and myth. For many reasons, manuals that are credulous about the inerrancy of the traditional rules don&#x2019;t serve writers well. Although some of the rules can make prose better, many of them make it worse, and writers are better off flouting them. The rules often mash together issues of grammatical correctness, logical coherence, formal style, and standard dialect, but a skilled writer needs to keep them straight. And the orthodox stylebooks are ill equipped to deal with an inescapable fact about language: it changes over time. Language is not a protocol legislated by an authority but rather a wiki that pools the contributions of millions of writers and speakers, who ceaselessly bend the language to their needs and who inexorably age, die, and get replaced by their children, who adapt the language in their turn.</p><p>Yet the authors of the classic manuals wrote as if the language they grew up with were immortal, and failed to cultivate an ear for ongoing change. Strunk and White, writing in the early and middle decades of the twentieth century, condemned then-new verbs like <i>personalize, finalize, host, chair, </i>and<i> debut,</i> and warned writers never to use <i>fix </i>for &#x201c;repair&#x201d; or <i>claim </i>for &#x201c;declare.&#x201d; Worse, they justified their peeves with cockamamie rationalizations. The verb <i>contact, </i>they argued, is &#x201c;vague and self-important. Do not <i>contact</i> people; get in touch with them, look them up, phone them, find them, or meet them.&#x201d; But of course the vagueness of <i>to contact </i>is exactly why it caught on: sometimes a writer doesn&#x2019;t need to know how one person will get in touch with another, as long as he does so. Or consider this head-scratcher, concocted to explain why a writer should never use a number word with <i>people,</i> only with <i>persons:</i> &#x201c;If of &#x2018;six people&#x2019; five went away, how many people would be left? Answer: one people.&#x201d; By the same logic, writers should avoid using numbers with irregular plurals such as <i>men, children, </i>and<i> teeth</i> (&#x201c;If of &#x2018;six children&#x2019; five went away&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;).</p><p>In the last edition published in his lifetime, White did acknowledge some changes to the language, instigated by &#x201c;youths&#x201d; who &#x201c;speak to other youths in a tongue of their own devising: they renovate the language with a wild vigor, as they would a basement apartment.&#x201d; White&#x2019;s condescension to these &#x201c;youths&#x201d; (now in their retirement years) led him to predict the passing of <i>nerd, psyched, ripoff, dude, geek, </i>and <i>funky,</i> all of which have become entrenched in the language.</p><p>The graybeard sensibilities of the style mavens come not just from an underappreciation of the fact of language change but from a lack of reflection on their own psychology. As people age, they confuse changes in themselves with changes in the world, and changes in the world with moral decline&#x2014;the illusion of the good old days.4 And so every generation believes that the kids today are degrading the language and taking civilization down with it:5</p><p>The common language is disappearing. It is slowly being crushed to death under the weight of verbal conglomerate, a pseudospeech at once both pretentious and feeble, that is created daily by millions of blunders and inaccuracies in grammar, syntax, idiom, metaphor, logic, and common sense.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In the history of modern English there is no period in which such victory over thought-in-speech has been so widespread.&#x2014;1978</p><p>Recent graduates, including those with university degrees, seem to have no mastery of the language at all. They cannot construct a simple declarative sentence, either orally or in writing. They cannot spell common, everyday words. Punctuation is apparently no longer taught. Grammar is a complete mystery to almost all recent graduates.&#x2014;1961</p><p>From every college in the country goes up the cry, &#x201c;Our freshmen can&#x2019;t spell, can&#x2019;t punctuate.&#x201d; Every high school is in disrepair because its pupils are so ignorant of the merest rudiments.&#x2014;1917</p><p>The vocabularies of the majority of high-school pupils are amazingly small. I always try to use simple English, and yet I have talked to classes when quite a minority of the pupils did not comprehend more than half of what I said.&#x2014;1889</p><p>Unless the present progress of change [is] arrested&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there can be no doubt that, in another century, the dialect of the Americans will become utterly unintelligible to an Englishman.&#x2014;1833</p><p>Our language (I mean the English) is degenerating very fast.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I begin to fear that it will be impossible to check it.&#x2014;1785</p><p>Complaints about the decline of language go at least as far back as the invention of the printing press. Soon after William Caxton set up the first one in England in 1478, he lamented, &#x201c;And certaynly our langage now vsed veryeth ferre from what whiche was vsed and spoken when I was borne.&#x201d; Indeed, moral panic about the decline of writing may be as old as writing itself:</p><p></p><p><i>Non Sequitur</i> � 2011 Wiley Ink, Inc. Dist. by Universal Uclick. Reprinted with permission. All rights reserved.</p><p></p><p>The cartoon is not much of an exaggeration. According to the English scholar Richard Lloyd-Jones, some of the clay tablets deciphered from ancient Sumerian include complaints about the deteriorating writing skills of the young.6</p><p>My discomfort with the classic style manuals has convinced me that we need a writing guide for the twenty-first century. It&#x2019;s not that I have the desire, to say nothing of the ability, to supplant <i>The Elements of Style. </i>Writers can profit by reading more than one style guide, and much of Strunk and White (as it is commonly called) is as timeless as it is charming. But much of it is not. Strunk was born in 1869, and today&#x2019;s writers cannot base their craft exclusively on the advice of a man who developed his sense of style before the invention of the telephone (let alone the Internet), before the advent of modern linguistics and cognitive science, before the wave of informalization that swept the world in the second half of the twentieth century.</p><p>A manual for the new millennium cannot just perpetuate the diktats of earlier manuals. Today&#x2019;s writers are infused by the spirit of scientific skepticism and the ethos of questioning authority. They should not be satisfied with &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the way it&#x2019;s done&#x201d; or &#x201c;Because I said so,&#x201d; and they deserve not to be patronized at any age. They rightly expect <i>reasons </i>for any advice that is foisted upon them.</p><p>Today we can provide the reasons. We have an understanding of grammatical phenomena which goes well beyond the traditional taxonomies based on crude analogies with Latin. We have a body of research on the mental dynamics of reading: the waxing and waning of memory load as readers comprehend a passage, the incrementing of their knowledge as they come to grasp its meaning, the blind alleys that can lead them astray. We have a body of history and criticism which can distinguish the rules that enhance clarity, grace, and emotional resonance from those that are based on myths and misunderstandings. By replacing dogma about usage with reason and evidence, I hope not just to avoid giving ham-fisted advice but to make the advice that I do give easier to remember than a list of dos and don&#x2019;ts. Providing reasons should also allow writers and editors to apply the guidelines judiciously, mindful of what they are designed to accomplish, rather than robotically.</p><p>&#x201c;The sense of style&#x201d; has a double meaning. The word <i>sense,</i> as in &#x201c;the sense of sight&#x201d; and &#x201c;a sense of humor,&#x201d; can refer to a faculty of mind, in this case the faculties of comprehension that resonate to a well-crafted sentence. It can also refer to &#x201c;good sense&#x201d; as opposed to &#x201c;nonsense,&#x201d; in this case the ability to discriminate between the principles that improve the quality of prose and the superstitions, fetishes, shibboleths, and initiation ordeals that have been passed down in the traditions of usage.</p><p><i>The Sense of Style </i>is not a reference manual<i> </i>in which you can find the answer to every question about hyphenation and capitalization. Nor is it a remedial guide for badly educated students who have yet to master the mechanics of a sentence. Like the classic guides, it is designed for people who know how to write and want to write better. This includes students who hope to improve the quality of their papers, aspiring critics and journalists who want to start a blog or column or series of reviews, and professionals who seek a cure for their academese, bureaucratese, corporatese, legalese, medicalese, or officialese. The book is also written for readers who seek no help in writing but are interested in letters and literature and curious about the ways in which the sciences of mind can illuminate how language works at its best.</p><p>My focus is on nonfiction, particularly genres that put a premium on clarity and coherence. But unlike the authors of the classic guides, I don&#x2019;t equate these virtues with plain words, austere expression, and formal style.7 You can write with clarity and with flair, too. And though the emphasis is on nonfiction, the explanations should be useful to fiction writers as well, because many principles of style apply whether the world being written about is real or imaginary. I like to think they might also be helpful to poets, orators, and other creative wordsmiths, who need to know the canons of pedestrian prose to flout them for rhetorical effect.</p><p>People often ask me whether anyone today even cares about style. The English language, they say, faces a new threat in the rise of the Internet, with its texting and tweeting, its email and chatrooms. Surely the craft of written expression has declined since the days before smartphones and the Web. You remember those days, don&#x2019;t you? Back in the 1980s, when teenagers spoke in fluent paragraphs, bureaucrats wrote in plain English, and every academic paper was a masterpiece in the art of the essay? (Or was it the 1970s?) The problem with the Internet-is-making-us-illiterate theory, of course, is that bad prose has burdened readers in every era. Professor Strunk tried to do something about it in 1918, when young Elwyn White was a student in his English class at Cornell.</p><p>What today&#x2019;s doomsayers fail to notice is that the very trends they deplore consist in oral media&#x2014;radio, telephones, and television&#x2014;giving way to written ones. Not so long ago it was radio and television that were said to be ruining the language. More than ever before, the currency of our social and cultural lives is the written word. And no, not all of it is the semiliterate ranting of Internet trolls. A little surfing will show that many Internet users value language that is clear, grammatical, and competently spelled and punctuated, not just in printed books and legacy media but in e-zines, blogs, Wikipedia entries, consumer reviews, and even a fair proportion of email. Surveys have shown that college students are writing more than their counterparts in earlier generations did, and that they make no more errors per page of writing.8 And contrary to an urban legend, they do not sprinkle their papers with smileys and instant-messaging abbreviations like IMHO and L8TR, any more than previous generations forgot how to use prepositions and articles out of the habit of omitting them from their telegrams. Members of the Internet generation, like all language users, fit their phrasing to the setting and audience, and have a good sense of what is appropriate in formal writing.</p><p>S...</p></p><h2>Stories of Beowulf Told to Children</h2><p>&#x201c;The Story of Beowulf Told to Children&#x201d; is an Anglo-Saxon saga retold in excellent English prose, with the heroic qualities emphasized. H. E. Marshall&#x2019;s story relates how Beowulf, the hero of the Anglo-Saxons, journeys to Daneland, and how he overcomes Grendel, the ogre, and his mother, the water witch, then returns to his own land to serve as king. After 50 years of peace, the fire dragon makes war on the Goth folk and Beowulf goes forth in combat against it, vanquishing his foe but in the end losing his life in ridding his people of its frightful enemy. An outstanding introduction to this tale for children ages 8 and up.</p><p>A widely read author of history books for children a century ago, Henrietta Elizabeth Marshall is now enjoying a resurgence in popularity. Her most famous work, Our Island Story, A History of England for Boys and Girls, was first published in 1905, followed quickly by Scotland&#x2019;s Story in 1906 and Our Empire Story in 1908. She also authored A History of France, A History of Germany, This Country of Ours, and English Literature for Boys and Girls. In addition, she penned The Story of Napoleon and The Story of Cromwell for the "Children&#x2019;s Heroes" series and contributed several volumes to the highly acclaimed "Told to the Children" series.</p><h2>The Activist</h2><p>Fiction. African American Studies. Straddling fiction and poetry, Renee Gladman&#39;s writing operates on the level of the sentence, constructing suprise and oblique meanings at every turn, and somehow managing the supremely difficult trick of both engaging and pushing the reader. &#34;THE ACTIVIST begins in the middle of a revolution....There is a bridge that may or may not have been bombed. People speak in nonsense and cannot stop themselves. In the mids of all this, the language of news reports mixes with the language of confession. The art of this beautifully written book is in how it touchingly illustrates that relations between humans and cities are linked in a more complex interface than most realize&#34;--Juliana Spahr.</p><p>Renee Gladman lives in Boston, Massachusettes, where she publishes Leon Works, a press for experimental fiction and cross-genre writing. Her books include NEWCOMER CAN&#39;T SWIM (Kelsey Street Press, 2007), A PICTURE-FEELING (Roof Books, 2005), THE ACTIVIST (Krupskaya, 2003), JUICE (Kelsey Street Press, 2000), NOT RIGHT NOW (Second Story Books, 1998), and Arlem (Idiom Books, 1996). A novella Event Factory is forthcoming from Dorothy, a publishing project in fall 2010. She teaches at Brown University in the Program for Literary Arts.Following up on her 2000 debut Juice (Kelsey Street), Gladman here pushes West Coast "new narrative" further into Kafka- and Poindexter-esque territory. A form of elliptical prose taken up in the '90s by writers like Dodie Bellamy, Mary Burger, Laura Moriarty and Camille Roy (and adapted by Gladman's peers Pamela Lu and Lytle Shaw), new narrative allows the basic elements of novels (plot, character, dialogue, specificity of setting) to run through the text without being sketched all the way in. By turns noirish first-person memoir and journalistic satire, The Activist depicts the goings on of a cell or affinity group that may or may not have blown up a bridge that may or may not have existed. Descriptions are inflected such that the names of characters (Lomarlo, Monique), their relations to each other (often same sex) and the way they talk ("This our downtown"; the title itself may be in the plural) put pressure on categories of race, gender and sexual orientation. The group may also have developed technology for emptying the memories of subjects, and controlling them Matrix-style, and their prevarications have a Godardian intellectualized haplessness. Yet the memory technology sets up the most powerful of the book's 10 sections, "The State," where it is unclear if the first-person narrator is being held by the government or by the activists, for what reason and to what purpose. The book works best as one of the first full-length mirrors held to the post 9/11 U.S.; in its targeting and rhetoric; it is something less than allegorical, more than a little chilling, and often very beautiful. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Energy Myths and Realities: Bringing Science to the Energy Policy Debate</h2><p>There are many misconceptions about the future of global energy often presented as fact by the media, politicians, business leaders, activists, and even scientists&#x2015;wasting time and money and hampering the development of progressive energy policies. <i>Energy Myths and Realities: Bringing Science to the Energy Policy Debate</i> debunks the most common fallacies to make way for a constructive, scientific approach to the global energy challenge.<br><br>When will the world run out of oil?

Labor and materials were plentiful and cheap, and new trends in home design made the prospect of homebuilding an exciting venture. This fascinating book, a reprint of a rare catalog of prefabricated houses from 1923, reveals in detail the types of design offered to those in the market for a new home in the early 1920s.<br>Of the 117 designs included, most are substantial middle-class homes. But the popularity of cottages and bungalows is also apparent in the wide selection of practical and appealing designs depicted. And there are large, formal homes as well, many of which embody America's unflagging interest in colonial styling. Some have affluent touches such as a sleeping porch or a sun room.

Or so thought "Wild" Bill Donovan when he secretly recruited a team of religious activists for the Office of Strategic Services. They entered into a world of lies, deception, and murder, confident that their nefarious deeds would eventually help them expand the kingdom of God.<br>In <i>Double Crossed</i>, historian Matthew Avery Sutton tells the extraordinary story of the entwined roles of spy-craft and faith in a world at war. Missionaries, priests, and rabbis, acutely aware of how their actions seemingly conflicted with their spiritual calling, carried out covert operations, bombings, and assassinations within the centers of global religious power, including Mecca, the Vatican, and Palestine. Working for eternal rewards rather than temporal spoils, these loyal secret soldiers proved willing to sacrifice and even to die for Franklin Roosevelt's crusade for global freedom of religion. Chosen for their intelligence, powers of persuasion, and ability to seamlessly blend into different environments, Donovan's recruits included people like John Birch, who led guerilla attacks against the Japanese, William Eddy, who laid the groundwork for the Allied invasion of North Africa, and Stewart Herman, who dropped lone-wolf agents into Nazi Germany. After securing victory, those who survived helped establish the CIA, ensuring that religion continued to influence American foreign policy. <br>Surprising and absorbing at every turn, <i>Double Crossed</i> is the untold story of World War II espionage and a profound account of the compromises and doubts that war forces on those who wage it.<br><br></p><p><b>Matthew Avery Sutton </b>is Edward R.

Shinning a light on the cross-and-dagger intrigues of Protestant missionaries who spied against the Axis, Sutton shows how they helped lay some of the moral and even diplomatic foundations for what we now call globalization.

Although their wartime scheming often conflicted with their religious principles, the work of the four men profiled here -- whose covert operations ranged from Europe to China and across the Middle East -- was absolutely critical to the success of U.S. military strategy and diplomacy, and it built the edifice for religious collaboration with espionage that, for better or worse, persists in the CIA to this day.

She lives in upstate New York.Standing in front of the morning room door, Liam smoothed back his dark brown hair and resisted the urge to give the tops of his boots a quick polish on the back of his trouser legs. His mother knew he'd already been out working, had requested this appointment during the time when he usually came in to spend an hour going over accounts and correspondence and, lately, to reply to the black-edged notes of condolence. She wouldn't expect him to look like anything but what he was-a man who tended the land that belonged to him and looked after the people who worked for him. The fact that he was now the Baron of Willowsbrook didn't change anything. He'd been riding over the land for twenty years now, had started visiting the tenant farms on his beloved sorrel pony when he was barely seven years old. She wouldn't criticize him for being dressed in clothes that were a bit sweaty and smelled of animals. <p> Maybe it was because she <i>wouldn't</i> criticize his appearance that he had the urge to run upstairs and put on a fresh shirt before stepping into a room that was bright, feminine, and soothing. </p><p> Giving the door a light rap with his knuckles, Liam walked into the room. His mother, Elinore, stood at the glass door that opened onto a small terrace, no doubt watching the birds that gathered to drink and bathe in the stone basin that was scrubbed and filled with fresh water every morning. The sunlight made the strands of gray in her light brown hair shine like silver. She was a small, slim woman with an inner strength that had weathered all the emotional storms of her marriage. </p><p> He may have inherited his father's looks-the dark hair, a face handsome enough to catch a woman's eye, height that was a little above average-but he was glad he'd inherited his mother's hazel eyes. Woodland eyes, she called them, because they were a brown-flecked green. Sometimes he wondered if, when she looked at him, she saw only a younger version of his father. At least when she looked at his eyes, she had to know there was a part of her in him, as well. </p><p> "Good morning, Mother," Liam said. He glanced at the tray on the table near the sofa and instantly became wary. The tea, thin sandwiches, and pastries weren't unusual fare for a midmorning chat, but the decanter of whiskey was definitely out of place. Elinore didn't approve of indulging in strong drink, especially so early in the day. That she'd arranged for the decanter to be here meant she thought one of them would need something more potent than tea to get through this conversation. </p><p> Turning away from the window, Elinore offered him a hesitant smile. "Good morning, Liam. Thank you for taking time out of your day to meet with me." </p><p> Heat washed through his body, a sure sign that his temper was rising. Making an effort to keep his voice calm, he replied, "Thanks aren't necessary. You're my mother. My being the baron now doesn't change that." At least, he hoped it didn't. </p><p> "No, but . . . it does change some things." She walked over to the sofa, sat down, and offered another hesitant smile. "Please sit down. There are some things I need to say to you." </p><p> Reluctantly, he sat on the other end of the sofa. Then something occurred to him that had him leaning toward her, tense. "Brooke's all right, isn't she?" </p><p> "Brooke?" </p><p> The surprise in Elinore's eyes, warming to amusement, made him feel limp with relief. His ten-year-old sister was a delightful child, but she did tend to get into scrapes. </p><p> "Brooke is fine," Elinore said, pouring tea for both of them. "A bit sulky since it's a lovely day and she's stuck doing lessons instead of working with the new pony a certain someone recently gave her for her birthday." </p><p> Taking the cup of tea she offered him, Liam gave her a bland stare. "I seem to recall another someone slipping money to that certain someone with the instructions to purchase new tack for the new pony." </p><p> "Is that what you recall?" Elinore asked innocently. "Do you also recall that certain someone telling Brooke she could skip her lessons this morning so that he could take her for a long ride so the pony wouldn't get bored working in the confines of the training ring?" </p><p> Liam choked on the tea he just swallowed. "I said maybe. After the midday meal." </p><p> " 'Maybe' means yes." </p><p> "Since when?" </p><p> She just looked at him until he wanted to squirm. That was the problem with trying to argue with his mother, even playfully. She knew him too well and remembered far too many things from his own childhood. </p><p> "After the midday meal, if she has her lessons done, I'll take her for a ride and we'll put the pony through his paces," Liam said. </p><p> "Listening to the two of you determine the definition of 'done' should be quite entertaining," Elinore said placidly. </p><p> "I-" Liam leaned back, feeling a bit sulky himself. He wasn't going to win this round. Brooke was his little sister. His baby sister. He'd already been away at school when she was born, and her first years were odd flashes of memory for him. A baby who drooled and giggled when he made funny faces at her. An infant who had learned to crawl between one visit home and the next, and had sent him into a panic when he'd put her on the carpet and turned his back for what he swore had been no more than a minute, only to have her disappear on him. The toddler who giggled and ran through the gardens as fast as her chubby little legs could take her. The bright little girl who chattered about anything and everything to the point where he'd nicknamed her Squirrel. The silent, wary child she became whenever his father was around. </p><p> As the male head of the family, he'd do his best to be firm about getting the lessons done, but the minute she turned those big blue eyes of hers on him, he'd cave. He remembered too well how it felt to be stuck indoors laboring over sums when the land beckoned. </p><p> "Liam." Elinore sipped her tea and didn't look at him. "Did you mortgage the estate?" </p><p> It didn't surprise him that she'd known his father had intended to take a mortgage out on the estate. No doubt the old baron had taken cruel delight in telling her he was stripping the land for everything it was worth. </p><p> When his father's man of business had gone over the accounts with him, he'd been appalled at the amount his father had intended to wring from the already foundering estate. And he'd felt an obscene kind of gratitude that the old baron had choked to death while dining with his current mistress before the papers had been signed. </p><p> "Yes, I took out a mortgage," Liam said, gulping down the rest of the tea. "A small one." Enough to pay off the tradesmen his father owed and give himself some money to honor his own bills for the next year or so. Elinore had provided him with a generous quarterly allowance ever since he'd first gone away to school, and he'd been grateful for it, but now that the estate was his, he didn't want to live off her money. With proper care and management, the land should be able to provide him and his family with a good living. </p><p> "I see." Elinore set her cup down, then folded her hands in her lap. She focused her gaze on the terrace door. "I'll make the same bargain with you that I made with your father." </p><p> <i>Don't treat me like I've become him just because I hold the title</i>, Liam thought fiercely. </p><p> "I'll pay the servants' wages and the household expenses," Elinore continued, her eyes still focused on the terrace door. "And I'll assist in paying any bills for the upkeep of the tenants' cottages. But I won't pay any bills for the upkeep of the town house in Durham, nor will I pay for any of your . . . personal . . . expenses." </p><p> Meaning, if he took a mistress as his father had done, he'd have to pay for his own pleasure. Not that he thought much pleasure could be had from a mercenary creature like the woman his father had been bedding when he died. On the other hand, he couldn't blame her for being mercenary. It had showed she'd had a better understanding of his father than the other women the old baron had enjoyed.\ </p><p> "It's a generous offer," he said. It stung that he had to accept it, but he was practical enough to know it would be a few years before the estate would recover sufficiently to pay all the expenses. "I thank you for it." </p><p> "Your father didn't think it was generous." </p><p> "My father and I didn't see eye to eye about a great many things," Liam said sharply. "Your father gave you an independent income for your benefit, not for my father's and not for the estate's. You had, and still have, every right to do with it as you please. Willowsbrook should be able to support itself twice over. The fact that it can't quite support itself is my father's-and his father's-fault, not yours." </p><p> After a long pause, Elinore said, "Would you like more tea?" </p><p> What he'd like was a hefty glass of that whiskey, but he had the feeling they'd only chewed the edges of whatever she'd wanted to talk to him about. "Please," he said, holding out his cup. He waited until she refilled both their cups. "Would you mind if I sold the town house in Durham?" </p><p> "The estate and any other property is yours now, Liam. You may do with it as you please." </p><p> "Would you mind?" he persisted. </p><p> When she looked at him, he saw a bitterness in her eyes she'd never allowed to show before. "There's nothing in that place that I value." </p><p> No, there wouldn't be, not when his father's string of mistresses had spent more time there than she had. Well, that was one burden and expense he could easily shed. He'd write to his man of business and set things in motion to sell the town house and its contents. </p><p> "Won't you need the town house when you have business in the city?" Elinore asked. </p><p> Liam shook his head. "I can rent rooms easily enough for the two times a year when the barons formally meet." </p><p> He felt a pressure building inside him, and he clamped his teeth to try to keep the words back as he'd done for so many years. Perhaps it was because the conversation was already difficult that he couldn't hold it back anymore. "Why didn't you leave him? He was a bastard, and you deserved so much better. Adultery is grounds for severing the marriage vow. You had income of your own, so you were never dependent upon him. Why did you stay?" </p><p> "I had three reasons," Elinore replied quietly. "You. Brooke. And Willowsbrook." </p><p> There was something about the way she said "Willowsbrook" that made him think she was talking about more than the estate. </p><p> "You're the baron now. You have authority and power, not just on the estate and tenant farms but over the villagers and the free landowners, as well. You can use that authority and power for ill or for good." </p><p> "I'm aware of that." </p><p> "How you act will set a precedent for the rest of the people here." </p><p> Liam snorted softly. "My father thankfully didn't set much of a precedent." </p><p> "If he'd ordered that something be done, that order would have been obeyed. The squires and magistrates in each village would have seen it carried out." </p><p> Liam rested one hand lightly over his mother's. "He still had to obey the decrees that the council of barons agree upon for the good of Sylvalan." </p><p> "The barons have the power to change the decrees or make new ones, regardless of what the rest of Sylvalan's people want. And a baron can impose his will over the people in the county he rules no matter what the decrees say." </p><p> She looked pale and unhappy, and he didn't know what she wanted from him. "To what use do you want me to put my new authority and power?" he asked gently. </p><p> "I want you to protect the witches at Willowsbrook-the Old Place this estate took its name from generations ago when your father's kin first came here to live and work the land." </p><p> Liam sighed, withdrew his hand. "Mother-" </p><p> "I have something to tell you," Elinore said hurriedly. "A secret I'd kept from your father because of a few things he'd said on our honeymoon. But you have to know. You have to understand." </p><p> "Understand what?" </p><p> Agitated, Elinore set her teacup on the table, then walked to the glass door. She stared at the world beyond the glass for a minute, as if she needed to draw strength from the view. Then she turned to face him. </p><p> "My great-great-grandfather was a witch's son," she said quietly. "He was the eldest son, but the Old Places always belong to the women of the family, and he wanted something to call his own. When he was a young man, he left home with his mother's blessing. He traveled for a few years, learned a bit about several trades as he worked for his food and lodging and a few coins to rub together. Then, one day, he saw a piece of land that made him want to put down roots, so his mother and grandmother helped him scrape together enough money to buy the land and build a small cottage. </p><p> "He had a gift for knowing what the land could yield and what needed time to ripen. He was canny when it came to business-and he was canny when it came to people. Like the land, he could sense what each could yield and when something or someone needed time to ripen. </p><p> "He prospered, and the people he dealt with prospered, as well. </p><p> "When he eventually married, he took a witch for a wife. They had several children, and the family continued to prosper. By then, his merchant business was turning a good profit, and he built a large, rambling country house. </p><p> "His eldest son went into the business with him, while the other sons and daughters found their callings in other kinds of work. In time, some of them fell in love, got married, and had children, and their children had children. </p><p> "And so it went. And while the family never hid their ties to the witches who lived in several of the Old Places, they also didn't flaunt those ties. As generations passed, not all of the spouses could make the same claim of having ties to an Old Place, and the gifts that come down through the blood became watered down or disappeared altogether." Elinore paused, then shook her head. "Not disappeared. Nuala says the Mother's gifts sometimes sleep in the blood, waiting to reappear again." She smiled sadly. "The name means nothing to you, does it? Our nearest neighbor for all of these years, and you don't even know who she is." </p><p> "Of course I know," Liam said testily. "She's one of the witches." </p><p> Elinore walked back to the sofa and sat down, folding her hands in her lap. She sighed. "Yes, she's one of the witches. She's also my father's cousin, several times removed." </p><p> Having no idea what she expected him to say, Liam drank his now-cold tea to give himself a little time. Given his father's animosity toward the witches who lived in the Old Place that bordered the estate, he understood quite well why his mother had never mentioned this aspect of her family heritage. But . . . </p><p> "As you said, it was several generations ago," Liam said, thinking she was worried about his feelings toward her changing. "You've no reason to feel shame because of it." </p><p> Elinore's eyes widened. "I'm not ashamed of my heritage. If I regret anything, it's that my gift from the Mother is so weak." Then she looked slightly annoyed. "Perhaps it's because it came down t...</p></p><h2>The Comedies (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>The Roman dramatist Terence (c. 186-159 BC) adapted many of his comedies from Greek sources, rendering them suitable for audiences of his own time by introducing subtler characterization and more complex plots. In his romantic play, <i>The Girl from Andros</i>, Terence portrays a love affair saved by a startling discovery. <i>The Self-Tormentor </i>focusses on a man's remorse after sending his son to war, and <i>The Eunuch</i> depicts a case of mistaken identity. Phormio is as rich in intrigue as a French farce, while <i>The Mother-in-Law</i> shows two families striving to save a marriage and The Brothers contrasts strict and lenient upbringings. With their tight plots and spare dialogue, Terence gave his plays a sense of humanity that became a model in the Renaissance and greatly influenced Moli�re.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

His analysis is placed within the context of the broader political and cultural development of New York City. This revised edition extends the scope of the book into the city's recent history, adding three decades to the study, covering the recent housing bubble crisis, the rebound and gentrification of the five boroughs, and the ecological issues facing the next generation of New Yorkers. More than 300 illustrations are integrated throughout the text, depicting housing plans, neighborhood changes, and city architecture over the past 130 years.

Black-and-white photographs.<br></p><p>James Elkins has worked as an art historian at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.<br> &nbsp;Unfocused but frequently illuminating meditations on how we see and how we don't. What the deconstructionists did for language, exposing its grave limitations and fallibilities, Elkins attempts to do for vision. As he convincingly demonstrates, ``vision is forever incomplete and uncontrollable because it is used to shape our sense of what we are.'' In Elkins's view, even the simplest, most reductive statement that can be made about seeing, ``the beholder looks at the object,'' is charged with such uncertainty and so many possible valences that it is incapable of any fixed or stable meaning. Seeing is also something that we have remarkably little control over, depending as it does on mood, thoughts, character, circumstance, etc., etc. Someone who is running late, for instance, suddenly becomes aware of a crowded world of clocks. As an art historian at Chicago's School of the Arts Institute, Elkins has a well-honed appreciation of the visual world, but he does have several substantial blind spots. He tends to cling too closely to his familiar tableaux morts, the unmoving, fixed images of paintings and photographs. Film and its shaping of vision are mentioned only in passing. Physics is similarly slighted, notably quantum mechanics and its discovery that the very act of perception can influence the results of an experiment. These omissions would not be so glaring if Elkins did not constantly try to find the telling in the trivial. Sometimes he is successful, such as in his discussions of animals' protective camouflage. But are six photographs of Chinese executions and a long discussion of the moment of death or extended disquisitions on nude models really relevant? In fairness, this is an enormous subject, and any account will be necessarily incomplete. Elkins is to be commended for shedding as much light as he does (and for elegantly abstaining from the temptations of academic jargon) in a ceaselessly thought-provoking book.

Tales of Bigfoot, the Yeti, and the Loch Ness monster are part of our collective experience. Now comes a book from two dedicated investigators that explores and elucidates the fascinating world of cryptozoology. <br><br>Daniel Loxton and Donald R. Prothero have written an entertaining, educational, and definitive text on cryptids, presenting the arguments both for and against their existence and systematically challenging the pseudoscience that perpetuates their myths. After examining the nature of science and pseudoscience and their relation to cryptozoology, Loxton and Prothero take on Bigfoot; the Yeti, or Abominable Snowman, and its cross-cultural incarnations; the Loch Ness monster and its highly publicized sightings; the evolution of the Great Sea Serpent; and Mokele Mbembe, or the Congo dinosaur. They conclude with an analysis of the psychology behind the persistent belief in paranormal phenomena, identifying the major players in cryptozoology, discussing the character of its subculture, and considering the challenge it poses to clear and critical thinking in our increasingly complex world.</p><p>Donald R. Prothero is a Research Associate in Vertebrate Paleontology at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. He has taught college geology and paleontology for 40 years at institutions such as Columbia University, Vassar College, Knox College, and Pierce College, and currently at Cal Poly Pomona. For 27 years, he was Professor of Geology at Occidental College in Los Angeles and Lecturer in Geobiology at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. He earned his M.A., M.Phil., and Ph.D. degrees in geological sciences from Columbia University. He is the author of over 300 scientific papers published in leading journals and over 30 titles in geology, paleontology and evolutionary biology.Loxton and Prothero have written what may well be the most important work to date on cryptozoology, taking its rightful place in the annals of skeptical literature in particular and scientific literature in general. Abominable Science! is the defining work on cryptozoology of our generation. (from the foreword by Michael Shermer, author of <i>The Believing Brain: From Ghosts and Gods to Politics and Conspiracies</i>)<br><br>Here, at last, is a scholarly, fully referenced work that presents a thoroughly reasonable, well-argued, skeptical perspective on some of the most iconic 'cryptids,' and it is fun to read and well illustrated to boot. Combining excellent and thorough research, ample references to the cryptozoological literature, and, most important, an appropriately level-headed, critical approach, <i>Abominable Science!</i> offers a novel, refreshing exploration of the world of cryptozoology. (Darren Naish, National Oceanography Centre, University of Southampton)<br><br>Nearly everyone&#x2015;scientist and layman alike&#x2015;would love the Loch Ness monster and other 'cryptids' to be real. Daniel Loxton and Donald R. Prothero, in their riveting exploration of cryptozoology, readily admit that some species (such as the living coelacanth and even the mountain gorilla) remained hidden to human experience until relatively recently. Yet they insist on hard evidence, thus running counter to the preferences of those who prefer to believe. Abominable Science! is a well-told, engaging story of skepticism. Loxton and Prothero present a lucid and compelling case to counter the false claims of cryptozoology.

She lives in upstate New York.In Sylvalan, a witch hunt is in full force. As witches and innocents are brutally murdered, magic disappears from the land, and the roads between the worlds of humans and of faery vanish one by one. Ari's family has tended one of the Old Places for generations, keeping the magic alive and the land lush and fertile. But with the midsummer moon, Ari's life changes dramatically. She unknowingly takes a <i>Fae</i> lover, the Lord of the Sun, and immediately becomes suspect to faery nobility, who neither trust nor mingle willingly with humankind, except for the occasional caprice. But Ari's life and the future of the Fae depend upon the nobles' willingness to change their elitist ways. For the inquisitor Adolpho--the Witch's Hammer--has come to Ari's door, and only the Fae and the secret of Ari's bloodline can save her and the magic she protects. Bishop only adds luster to her reputation for fine fantasy. <i>Paula Luedtke</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This kind an openhearted man was also a private man, usually preferring the company of his cats to that of his two-legged acquaintances. <p> But much about Gorey was revealed in his environment. His house in Yarmouthport, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod, was filled with his multifarious collections of objects, from books and bottles to finials and rings, stuffed animals and rocks. He arranged his clutter in an order that made sense only to him. </p><p> In "Elephant House: Or, The Home of Edward Gorey," Kevin McDermott elegantly documents in rich duotone and full-color photographs this chockablock house, room by room, just as Gorey left it when he died in April 2000. With each picture we obtain new insight into a man whose prolific creative genius was fed as much by his keen intelligence as by his flights of whimsy and absurdity. We are startled by the simple beauty of his arrangement of blue glass bottles in a library window. In noticing that his kitchen counter is almost completely covered by an arrangement of rocks, we wonder how he managed to entertain guests with a home-cooked dinner of all-blue food. And we linger over the picture of his desk, imaginging him at work there; it is such a small desk, blotted with ink (of course!) and crowded with pens, rubber stamps, a ruler - and a black old-style dial phone. </p><p> Elephant House may be the most intimate portrait of Edward Gorey ever published. McDermott's reminiscences and descriptions of the house accompany his engaging photographs, and more than a dozen of Gorey's etchings and drawings of elephants - never before published - are paired with quotes from the artist. Through this portrait, Edward Gorey becomes even more the man we all wish we had had the chance to meet, an artist whose brilliant and hilarious art and words will continue to charm and delight us for generations to come.</p>Kevin McDermott was born and raised in Lorain, Ohio. He met Edward Gorey in 1985 as an acting student at New York University performing in the premier production of Gorey&#39;s Tinned Lettuce. He has worked as an actor, producer (producting two of Gorey&#39;s shows off-Broadway), graphic designer, and photographer. He also helps maintain the Edward Gorey archive. He lives in New York City.

Particularly moving is "Days of 1981," in which he recalls the memory of his first gay lover--a sculptor he met in a bar. "Nothing was promised, nothing sustained/or lethal offered. I wish I'd kept the heart./Even the emblems of our own embarrassment/become acceptable to us, after a while." Doty derives much of his success by offering readers a full gulp of his longish verse, rather than teasing, incomplete sips. <b>My Alexandria</b> won the National Book Critics Circle Award for Poetry for 1993.<b>Mark Doty,</b> the recipient of a 1994 Whiting Writers' Award, is the author of two previous books of poetry, <i>Turtle, Swan</i> and <i>Bethlehem in Broad Daylight.</i> His next collection is <i>Atlantis.</i><br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Dante&#39;s Vita Nuova</h2><p><p>In this new edition Musa views Dante's intention as one of cruel and comic commentary on the shallowness and self-pity of his protagonist, who only occasionally glimpses the true nature of love. </p><p>... the explication de texte which accompanies [Musa's] translation is instructively novel, always admirable....

Cornelius J. Dyck interacts with the many changes in the Anabaptist/Mennonite experience and historical understandings in this revised and updated edition. This is a history of Mennonites from the 16th century to the present. Though simply written, it reflects fine scholarship and deep Christian concern.</p><p><b><p>Cornelius J. Dyck received his PhD degree from the University of Chicago and has served as visiting fellow at other centers and universities in North America and Europe. In addition to teaching at the Associated Mennonite Biblical Seminaries from 1959, Dyck was for two decades director of the Institute of Mennonite Studies. He is the author and editor of numerous books and articles in professional journals.</p></b></p><h2>Roasting: A Simple Art</h2><p><p> </p><blockquote>When you're hungry, roast. <br> When you're in a rush, roast. <br> When you're in doubt, roast. <br> When you're entertaining, roast. </blockquote> <p></p><p>Crank up the oven and throw in a chicken; roasting is simply the easiest and best way to concentrate and deepen flavor, to seal in succulence, and make robust, crusty, and sweet all kinds of meats, birds, fish, fruits, and vegetables. Roasting offers more flavor on its own than any other cooking technique. Everything you need for a lifetime of happy roasting can be found here in the pages of Barbara Kafka's ground-breaking new book. Even baby goat, a suckling pig, and loin of buffalo make it into this bible of roasting. </p><p> <em>Roasting</em> is absolutely essential, whether you're planning to roast a potato or leg of lamb, a turkey or a tomato, a pepper or a red snapper. Barbara's fussless high-temperature method caramelizes the surface of meat, the skin of birds or fish, or the outside of vegetables, transforming them into such savory sweet dishes as Roast Chicken with Pomegranate Glaze and Fresh Mint, aromatic Garlic Roast Pork Loin, moist and sweet Roasted Striped Bass with Fennel, and Whole Roasted Peaches with Ginger Syrup. </p><p> Nearly one hundred stellar recipes for roasted vegetables attest to the fact that Barbara Kafka's new book is not for meat eaters alone. The recipes for roasted vegetables begin where other books leave off. Try the Roasted Sliced Fennel Bulb and the Roasted Chinese Eggplant with Balsamic Marinade, the Roasted Portobello Mushrooms with Garlic Marinade, and more. </p><p> <em>Roasting</em> is packed with indispensable tips, techniques, and innovative cooking ideas. There are great recipes for marinades, salsas, vinaigrettes, and stuffings. You'll also find an inspiring assortment of simple but original recipes for sauces that will lift your everyday roasts into perfect party fare. You'll discover, too, the many joys of "companion roasting," learning when to add the carrots or the onions so they don't over- or undercook, and guaranteeing everything comes out at the same time. </p><p> Never a believer in unnecessary work, Barbara Kafka is a cook's best friend. Barbara never follows; she blazes new trails, challenging the sacred rules of roasting by never trussing a chicken or basting a turkey. She proves you can actually walk away from your oven and enjoy your food and your guests. It's all so quick and easy, most dishes don't need to go into the oven until your guests walk in the door. </p><p> Often the best part of the roast is the leftovers, and <em>Roasting</em> is overflowing with possibilities. In Barbara's knowing hands leftover onions become a smoky-flavored Roasted Onion Soup with Cannellini Beans; last night's roasted cod and boiled potatoes are transformed into a scrumptious Best Cod Hash; a deeply flavored Roast Duck Pasta Sauce is a rich reward to the cook for having made last night's duck dinner. Nearly one hundred recipes for leftovers show you how to build them into new meals of soups, salads, pasta sauces, hashes, fritters, fish cakes, and more. </p><p> Replete with all the tables, timing charts, and the encyclopedic wisdom that are hallmarks of every Barbara Kafka book, <em>Roasting: A Simple Art</em> is a dream of a cookbook, one that will soon bear the soils, stains, and well-worn pages of constant and creative use. </p></p><p>Kafka believes in &#34;hot ovens, short roasting times, and rare meat,&#34; so most recipes in this cookbook start with &#34;heat oven to 500x F.&#34; The result is food with profound flavors that is sensible, even primal, yet has the flair you&#39;d expect from an opinionated pro. Despite controversy over her recipe for roast turkey, this book so impressed her peers that they voted it a Julia Child Cookbook Award in 1995. Herbivores rejoice: There are over 100 mouth-watering recipes for vegetables and some fruits, too, along with those for roasted meats, poultry and fish.<p>Barbara Kafka is the bestselling author of <em>Roasting: A Simple Art,</em> which won a Julia Child Cookbook Award, and <em>Party Food.</em> She writes on a regular basis for <em>The New York Times,</em> is a TVFN (Television Food Network) regular, and contributes to numerous food magazines.

In a straightforward style, West debunks numerous widely held myths about the Founders&#39; political thought. He contrasts the Founders&#39; ideas of liberty and equality with today&#39;s, concluding that contemporary notions of liberalism bear almost no resemblance to the concepts originally articulated by the Founders.</p><p><b>Thomas G. West</b> is professor of politics at the University of Dallas and a senior fellow at the Claremont Institute.One of those rare publications that promises to shape the field of inquiry about the American founders for decades to come. (Newt Gingrich)<br><br>A pathbreaking book. The American people finally have a definitive answer to the distortions about the founding that liberals have been pouring into the American mind since the 1960s. I recommend this book heartily. It belongs on every bookshelf and in every classroom in America. (Rush Limbaugh)<br><br><i>Vindicating the Founders</i> is important but (relatively) easy. Learning from them is more difficult. This book helps us learn from Jefferson, Hamilton, and Madison. And there aren't many better teachers about America. (William Kristol, editor, The Weekly Standard)<br><br>Compelling, accurate, closely reasoned, and entirely convincing. (Forrest McDonald, University of Alabama; author of We the People)<br><br>A valuable contribution to history and government studies on the founding. (Herman Belz, University of Maryland)<br><br><i>Vindicating the Founders</i> is an eloquent defense of the principles of the American founding by one of its most learned students. (Dinesh D'Souza, American Enterprise Institute)<br><br>West is committed to understanding the American founders accurately and in their own terms. His work is unfailingly penetrating and trustworthy, and I eagerly seek it out. (Michael Novak, former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Human Rights Commission, 1994 Templeton laureate)<br><br>A provocative and interesting book. (J. D. Born, Jr., Wichita State University)<br><br>Americans can count themselves fortunate to have at the bar a scholar of West's erudition, good sense, and tenacity. (<i>The Weekly Standard</i>)<br><br>West shows how textbooks charge the American Founders with not conforming to present-day standards of political correctness. He also shows how the Founders nevertheless deserve the admiration that they used to receive from teachers and school children many decades ago. West's arguments are convincing. (Leland B. Yeager, Auburn University)</p><h2>Cradle of Flavor: Home Cooking from the Spice Islands of Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia</h2><p><p><strong>The first book to reveal the undiscovered jewels of Southeast Asian cuisine.</strong></p> Just when you thought you knew everything about Asian food, along comes James Oseland&#x2019;s <em>Cradle of Flavor</em>. Oseland has spent two decades exploring the foods of the Spice Islands. Few can introduce us to the birthplace of spice as he does. He brings us the Nyonya dishes of Singapore and Malaysia, the fiery specialties of West Sumatra, and the spicy-aromatic stews of Java. Oseland culled his recipes from twenty years of intimate contact with home cooks and diverse markets. He presents them here in easily made, accessible recipes, perfect for today&#x2019;s home cook. Included is a helpful glossary (illustrated in color in one of the picture sections) of all the ingredients you need to make the dishes and where and how to buy them. With <em>Cradle of Flavor</em>, fans of Javanese Satay, Singaporean Stir-Fried Noodles, and Indonesian curries can finally make them in their own kitchen.</p><p><strong>James Oseland</strong>&#x2019;s writing has appeared in <em>Gourmet, Saveur</em>, and <em>Vogue</em>. He has been traveling to Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia for twenty years. He lives in New York City.Oseland, who has lived in Singapore for 20 years, hopes to help people who haven't had the benefit of a trip to West Sumatra or Kuala Lumpur to discover those places' scents and tastes. Oseland devotes close to half the book to explaining ingredients, techniques and eating traditions as well as relating anecdotes from 20 years of roaming the islands and picking up the natives' cooking wisdom. Many ingredients will require special trips to ethnic markets, though Oseland allows for some substitution or omission of difficult-to-find items like fresh galangal or daun salam leaves. The first chapter covers sambals, every meal's essential spicy accompaniment, as well as other small dishes like the fiery Sweet-Sour Cucumber and Carrot Pickle with Turmeric; he follows with slightly more familiar street foods and snacks such as satays and gado-gado, then rice and noodles in all their guises, from simple, heavenly steamed rice to the zingy Malaysian Penang-Style Stir-Fried Kuey Teow Noodles. Oseland's instructions are detailed, and he makes a convincing case that with a little time and care, the best of these complex, interrelated cuisines can be enjoyed thousands of miles from their origin.

It is a poem that vividly encapsulates the great issues and debates of the day and acts as a commentary on cataclysmic events such as the Peasants' Revolt (1381), the condemnation of Wyclif's ideas (1382) and the rise of Lollardy. It is also one of the greatest poems of the English Middle Ages, worth reading beside Dante and Chaucer.The poem has provoked a sophisticated and wide-ranging critical literature. It needs to be read in an edition by an expert conceived with the student-reader in mind. Of the A, B and C versions of the text of Piers Plowman, only a student-geared edition of the B-text exists and that edition is now becoming dated. The C-text, which supersedes B in terms of Langland's poetic career, is also a more complete and carefully structured poem. It needs to be available in an equally readerly edition; this is such an edition. For his new edition of the C-text of Piers Plowman, Derek Pearsall has completely revised the text, added side glosses for the benefit of student readers of the poem (though without sacrificing the glossary), and revised and updated the explanatory notes. The Introduction has also been expanded, revised and reshaped to take account of this. Since the new edition involves a significant reworking of the previous edition and justifies library copy replacement, a hardback library edition will be available for a limited period.<br></p><p><br><strong>Derek Pearsall </strong>is Professor Emeritus of Harvard University and a pre-eminent scholar of Langland and Chaucer; he has published widely on both authors.<br><br>"Scholarly and accessible, this will be an invaluable edition for both students of the poem and those specializing in the field."--<em>Medium Aevum</em> <br><p></p><br>"... making this edition one of the most valuable tools available."--<em>Year's Work in English Studies</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>The Power to Heal</h2><p>First published over thirty years ago, Francis MacNutt's <i>The Power to Heal</i> has now sold over 250,000 copies and remains one of the classic works on healing and healing prayer.

Just then, a puff of wind lifts the rolling, flapping bag over a chain-link fence and into the lives of several townsfolk &#x2014; a can-collecting girl, a homeless man, a store owner &#x2014; not that all of them notice. Renowned poet Ted Kooser fashions an understated yet compassionate world full of happenstance and connection, neglect and care, all perfectly expressed in Barry Root&#x2019;s tender illustrations.

He lives in Quarryville, Pennsylvania.Grade 4&#x2013;6&#x2014;In his first children's book, the former U.S. Poet Laureate and Pulitzer Prize winner tells an environmental story about a plastic grocery bag as it is blown out of a landfill, over a considerable distance, and eventually into the hands of some people who reuse it. Young Margaret picks it up to carry discarded cans she sells for scrap metal. A woman uses it to block a draft under her door. Two street people pick it up but eventually drop it. A man bundles it with other bags and sells them to a woman who runs a secondhand store. The story comes full circle when Margaret buys a baseball glove and ball there and carries her purchases home in the very bag she had initially found. Root's watercolor and gouache paintings, often golden-hued landscape spreads, follow the bag from its bright early-morning wanderings, through the day and shadowy night, and into the daylight once again. Long, compound sentences flow smoothly as they describe the bag's protracted journey, offering poetic images such as "clouds like enormous black leaf bags" that race across the moon. Older children who can listen to the lengthy text will benefit from hearing the beauty of the language and, in addition, will learn about recycling plastic bags from the informative author's note.&#x2014;<i>Marianne Saccardi, formerly at Norwalk Community College, CT</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As Chris tries to remake and modernize his corrupt department, bringing in new deputies, including young America Reynosa and Ben Harper--a hard-edged veteran homicide detective now lured out of retirement--he finds himself constantly staring down a town unwilling to change, friends and enemies unable to let go of the past, and the harsh limits of his badge.<br><br>But it's only when a local Rio Grande guide is brutally and inexplicably murdered, and America and Ben's ongoing investigation is swept aside by a secretive federal agent, that the novice sheriff truly understands just how tenuous his hold on that badge really is.

Thick drops of it all down U.S. 90, bleeding off the rear fender of the Nissan Maxima that was trying hard to disappear in his windshield and throwing up dust as it swerved across lanes and the shoulder.<br><br>All that blood from one of his deputies, Tommy Milford. Chris still didn't know whether he was alive or dead.<br><br>Another of his deputies, Dale Holt, was ten miles back with him. He'd been riding shotgun with Tommy when it all happened, and although he was barely one year older than the injured boy, when Chris had left them both behind, Dale had been holding Tommy's hand like a father might a son, telling him over and over again to hang in there, brother, hang in there while they waited for the ambulance, because no one had been sure if it was a good idea to move Tommy or not. Honestly, it hadn't looked good either way. But Dale, even before calling it in-even before kneeling down next to his damaged friend and grabbing his shaking hand and shielding his body with his own-had gotten off a handful of rounds at the fleeing Nissan, and after this was all done they'd be out here looking for them in the desert, shining bright among the ocotillo and the cat's-claw and the creosote; prying them out of the car's metal body. At least one had definitely punched through the rear windshield, spiderwebbing the safety glass and X'ing the spot where a passenger's head might be.<br><br>Chris tried hard to focus on that, rather than his deputy's blood drying on the asphalt.<br><br>He prayed that Tommy was hanging on to Dale's hand right now, squeezing back just as hard with each heartbeat, letting Dale and everyone else know he was still alive.<br><br>Hanging on tight.<br><br>Please don't die. God, not today.<br><br>Not today. Not Tommy's first damn day on the job.<br><br>Deputy Am&#x17d; Reynosa blasted past Chris, shooting up the shoulder, close enough they almost traded paint. He�d already barked at her once on the radio to stay behind him but she wasn�t listening and clearly wasn�t going to. He caught up to her and pushed ahead. They were both pushing ninety now, heading toward a hundred, chewing up the distance on the Maxima, whose back end suddenly fishtailed, brake lights flickering on and off. The driver must have seen the red and blue strobes on Chief Deputy Ben Harper�s truck up ahead, bright and clear and ominous even in broad daylight, leaving him surprised and really scared and unsure of what to do; maybe even bleeding out, if Dale�s bullet had bent the curve and clipped the driver while passing through the car�s interior. Harp had been out at Artesia most of the day but had been rolling back to Murfee when Dale fired his first shot, which put him right in the path of the fleeing car, so Chris had radioed for him to lay up at mile marker 67 and toss out the spike strip.<br><br>Chris glanced over at the small green signs blurring past his window.<br><br>Marker 65<br><br>The strips were an expensive Stinger Spike System. He'd been reluctant to buy them at first, reading that some officers and deputies had been killed trying to deploy the damn things-struck by the very cars they were trying to stop-and Harp hadn't helped the cause by admitting that the Dallas PD had recently banned them.<br><br>But out here there was so much empty space, so much straight-line nothing, that you could chase someone all the way to El Paso or right down to fucking Mexico if you didn't have a way to slow them down.<br><br>So Harp had pushed and pushed for them, and in the end, Chris had agreed. Caved. That had become the defining nature of their relationship.<br><br>In fact, Chris had ordered two sets for each patrol truck, enough to cross both lanes. They'd proved easy enough to set up when his deputies had practiced it out in the department parking lot, but so far they'd never been used-not in real life, not like this.<br><br>Marker 66<br><br>Almost there.<br><br>Chris backed off the gas and hoped those damn spikes worked . . . and hoped to hell that Harp was out of the way.<br><br>The Nissan�s tires grabbed the pavement hard-spitting rocks and boiling smoke-as the driver locked them up, with both car and driver holding on for life as the Nissan started to slide sideways. It tipped ever so slightly up, catching air as the whole car shuddered, looking for one horrible second like it might roll and tumble down Highway 90 in a mess of buckled metal and broken glass, before straightening out and hitting the strips square at sixty miles an hour. The hollow spike tips punctured all four radials clean, and Chris swore he saw a dance of bright sparks beneath the Nissan-a July Fourth light show-as it plowed over the strips and kept going even as its tires died beneath it.<br><br>Chris drove off the shoulder into the scrub, giving the strips a wide berth and catching air himself, as Harp's truck roared to life and paralleled him from where it had been parked on the opposite shoulder. Harp had gotten clear from the truck, never even bothering to use it for cover in case the Nissan's driver lost complete control and plowed into it. Instead, he'd been crouched low with his Colt AR-15 aimed straight and steady into the other car's oncoming windshield. As it slid past, he'd calmly stood up and tracked it with his sights, before running back to his own truck.<br><br>Now, he and Chris were slow-rolling up to the Nissan, which had finally come to rest in the middle of the road, nose canted at an angle, the driver's door visible to both of them but still closed. The car sat wreathed in smoke, all of its tinted windows dirty. The car itself looked exhausted, worn out; sporting an ugly metallic scar down the left flank-another one of Dale's bullets.<br><br>And Tommy's blood, which had been so bright and visible to Chris only moments before, was now lost to the dust.<br><br>Chris got out with his Browning A5 and positioned himself behind his engine block, while Harp opposite of him did the same. Am&#x17d; rolled to a hard stop behind them both, and with his attention full on the Nissan, Chris felt rather than saw her join him at his shoulder.<br><br>She was breathing hard, her Colt 1911 resting over the hood.<br><br>"Son of a bitch," she said. "Pendejo."<br><br>"Exactly," Chris agreed. He stole one glance at her; hair in her eyes and those dark eyes narrowed and angry, trying hard to see beyond the Nissan's windows. And for the first time since he'd made her a Big Bend County deputy, he was regretting it. Not that she wasn't capable-she'd more than proven her worth and was tougher than he ever could have imagined-but because of moments like this one, right now.<br><br>He didn't want to send her in harm's way and he knew that was exactly what he was going to have to do.<br><br>In two years as sheriff, none of his deputies had gotten hurt on his watch. It was like a run of cool, calm weather, or a desert rain. It couldn't last forever and maybe it wasn't supposed to.<br><br>But he was going to make damn sure it wasn't two in one day.<br><br>�Sheriff, time is wasting.� Harp�s voice carried over the road.<br><br>His chief deputy was pushing, his idea of subtle. Harp always complained that Chris was too slow, too measured; too goddamn deliberate . . . just like their long debate over ordering the Stinger system. Even though he won more than he lost, the older man still liked to needle Chris: It's all about action versus reaction, Sheriff . . . you can't finish what you don't start. These were Harp's idea of lessons, freely and frequently given, and Am&#x17d; Reynosa had already taken way too many of them to heart.<br><br>It didn't take much for Chris to imagine what his two deputies would think about his first impulse here and now: to keep them all safe behind their trucks and just wait the fucking guy in the Nissan out.<br><br>All afternoon if they had to; hoping against hope that he got tired and gave up.<br><br>Now that was goddamn deliberate.<br><br>But there was another of Harp's sharp lessons: Chris, hope is not a strategy . . .<br><br>Sheriff, time is wasting.<br><br>Fuck me.<br><br>Chris took a long breath, turning to Am&#x17d;. �Okay, I�m going to call him out. If we�re lucky, there�s only the one and maybe he�s already hurt. I�m going to walk him backward between us and when I stop him and tell him to get on his knees, you�re going to go up, put him facedown, and cuff him. I�ll stay covered on the car in case someone else is in there. I�ve got the best angle on it, so Harp is going to stay covered on you. If our bad guy so much as flinches, reaches for anything, even breathes too hard, Harp will take the shot. Got that?�<br><br>Am&#x17d; nodded, already grabbing for cuffs and making ready to move down to the rear of the truck, near to where she'd have to expose herself. It wouldn't be much and it wouldn't be long, but it would be enough.<br><br>Chris put a hand on her shoulder. "You're angry, we all are. It's not personal. Just do it by the numbers. Wait till he's on his knees." Chris let her go. "You good?" he asked.<br><br>She smiled, grim. "Bueno."<br><br>Chris waved toward Harp to get his attention, raising his voice. "I'll call the guy back. Am&#x17d; is contact, you're cover." Harp never took his eyes off the Nissan, didn't respond, but hitched up a thumb . . . okay.<br><br>In a perfect world, Chris would've put hands on the guy himself, but he didn't have faith in his bad knee. It had never fully recovered after he'd reinjured it at the Far Six. You've never fully recovered. He pushed that cold thought away. But fortunately Harp had spent almost three decades on the Midland PD, many of those years as part of their SWAT team. Even though he and Am&#x17d; had spent a lot of free hours together at the makeshift range near Chapel Mesa, and Harp claimed she'd developed a hell of a shooter's eye, Chris still felt comfortable with Harp taking a tight shot more than anyone, far more than even himself. The chief deputy was the only person who had killed more men than Chris. That left Am&#x17d; as the best choice, the only choice, to approach the driver if he ever showed himself.<br><br>Chris took another deep breath, steadied himself. He squinted past the shortened barrel of his A5 to the Nissan. Still there, still waiting.<br><br>Waiting for him to do something. Just like his two deputies.<br><br>"Driver, roll down the windows and throw out the keys. Then extend your left hand through the window and open the door." His voice surprised him, too loud.<br><br>Nothing happened and the Nissan kept idling.<br><br>"Driver, roll down the windows and throw out the keys." Or what, exactly? Chris didn't want to send Harp and Am&#x17d; up to the car to forcibly pull the driver out, there was too much open ground to cover and it was too naked, too exposed. And they sure weren't going to start pumping lead into it from here. Even if he made that threat, would the driver believe it? Could he even make it sound believable? Maybe he'd get his wish after all and they'd just sit here the rest of the day like Old West gunfighters in a duel, forever trapped at high noon; neither of them ever drawing.<br><br>Fuck me.<br><br>Sweat collected in his eyes. None of his options were good, all of them just different kinds of bad. His shirt stuck to him like a second skin; that high white sun hammering hard. It had been infernal hot for days, with no end in sight. The scrub all around them was burned brown, skeletal; brittle and quick to turn to dust. Except for the yucca standing tall and crowned with its ivory flowers and marching into the distance toward the mountains, the rest of the world out here looked and felt lifeless. Like a hot breath would be all it'd take to set it aflame.<br><br>The air above the car rolled back and forth in waves, reflecting the engine heat back skyward, where it got lost.<br><br>Impatient, Am&#x17d; started inching forward, moving beyond the safety of his truck's tailgate; too far away from him to pull her back. Just like he feared, she'd been listening to Harp too damn much.<br><br>"Driver . . ." He started again, angrier, but before he could call out anything else, the driver's-side window slid down.<br><br>Chris braced, found a point in the darkened interior and kept his A5 on it, realizing the engine had also stopped.<br><br>The car was now silent, still.<br><br>Long moments passed, everyone holding their breath.<br><br>Then keys tumbled out of the open window, jingling loudly, and landed on the asphalt.<br><br>Followed finally by a slim arm, grabbing the door handle as he'd instructed and opening the door.<br><br>A man got out.<br><br>No, that wasn't quite right; he was younger than that, early twenties, maybe, a Hispanic male in black jeans and a white T-shirt. His hair was slicked back and he still had sunglasses on-metallic, small frame, designer.<br><br>There was no sign of blood.<br><br>Chris put the A5 on him. "Driver, turn around once, and then lock your hands together behind your head and walk backwards . . . slow . . . until I order you to stop."<br><br>The kid-and that's how Chris saw him, even though Chris wasn't a whole lot older than him-did as he was told. The watch on his wrist was big and looked expensive. It caught all of that impossible, fiery sunlight, and winked it back at Chris and his deputies as he put his hands behind his head. They might have been shaking, too, just a slight tremble matching the kid's heartbeat. He started walking backward, trying to catch a glance over his shoulder.<br><br>"Look straight ahead and keep walking. Slow." Now that the door was open Chris could see all the way through the cabin. There was no one else in the front passenger seat, but that didn't mean there wasn't someone curled up in the back. He still needed to clear the car while Harp and Am&#x17d; dealt with the kid.</p><h2>Where the Trout Are All as Long as Your Leg (John Gierach&#39;s Fly-fishing Library)</h2><p>Brilliant, witty, perceptive essays about fly-fishing, the natural world, and life in general by the acknowledged master of fishing writers.<br><br>Fly-fishing&#x2019;s finest scribe, John Gierach, takes us from a nameless stream on a nameless ranch in Montana to a secret pool off a secret creek where he caught a catfish as a five-year-old, to a brook full of rattlesnakes and a private pond where the trout are all as long as your leg. As Gierach says, &#x201c;The secret places are the soul of fishing.&#x201d; Hearing about a new one never fails to entice us. <br><br>And so <i>Where the Trout Are All as Long</i> <i>as Your Leg</i> transports the reader to the best of these places, where the fish are always bigger and the hatches last forever. After all, it&#x2019;s these magical places that Gierach so vividly evokes that remind us how precious&#x2014;and precarious&#x2014;are the unspoiled havens of the natural world.</p><p>"The secret places are the soul of fishing.... It may be a private spring creek with armed guards where there are huge browns and lots of them, or it may just be an unknown beaver pond where a handful of book trout have grown to a whopping eleven inches. In either case, it's a spot that, by the simple virtue of being left more or less alone, has reached is full potential."So begins this brilliant short book, in which half a dozen such places are featured. There is a pool made memorable because it is part of a risky childhood adventure; hidden local streams; sections of a wealthy ranch; secret stretches - full of rattlesnakes - and private ponds with trout as long as your leg. All are made magically vivid by Gierach's special prose - and all stand starkly against a more public natural world increasingly threatened with ecological disaster.

When the travel bug hit again, he decided to go big-time, taking on the world&#x2019;s most populous and intriguing nation. In <i>Lost on Planet China, </i>Troost escorts readers on a rollicking journey through the new beating heart of the modern world, from the megalopolises of Beijing and Shanghai to the Gobi Desert and the hinterlands of Tibet. <br><i><br>Lost on Planet China</i> finds Troost dodging deadly drivers in Shanghai; eating Yak in Tibet; deciphering restaurant menus (offering local favorites such as Cattle Penis with Garlic); visiting with Chairman Mao (still dead, very orange); and hiking (with 80,000 other people) up Tai Shan, China&#x2019;s most revered mountain. But in addition to his trademark gonzo adventures, the book also delivers a telling look at a vast and complex country on the brink of transformation that will soon shape the way we all work, live, and think.

What he finds is a country with its feet suctioned in the clay of traditional culture and a head straining into the polluted stratosphere of unencumbered capitalism, where cyclopean portraits of Chairman Mao (largely perceived as mostly good, except for that nasty bit toward the end) spoon comfortably with Hong Kong's embrace of rat-race modernity. From Beijing and its blitzes of flying phlegm--and girls who lend new meaning to "Chinese take-out"--to the legendary valley of Shangri-La (as officially designated by the Party), Troost learns that his very survival may hinge on his underdeveloped haggling skills and a willingness to deploy <i>Rollerball</i>-grade elbows over a seat on a train. Featuring visits to Mao's George Hamiltonian corpse and a rural market offering Siberian Tiger paw, cobra hearts, and scorpion kebabs (in the food section), <i>Lost on Planet China</i> is a funny and engrossing trip across a nation that increasingly demands the world's attention. <i>--Jon Foro</i> <p></p> <b>Maarten Troost's Travel Tips for China</b> <p></p> <b>1. </b>Food can be classified as meat, poultry, grain, fish, fruit, vegetable and Chinese. Embrace the Chinese. If you love it, it will love you back. True, you may find yourself perplexed by what resides on your plate. You may even be appalled. The Chinese have an expression: <i>We eat everything with four legs except the table, and anything with two legs except the person</i>. They mean it too. And so you may find yourself in a restaurant in Guangzhou contemplating the spicy cow veins; or the yak dumplings in Lhasa, or the grilled frog in Shanghai, or the donkey hotpot in the Hexi Corridor, or the live squid on the island of Putuoshan. And you may not know, exactly, what it is you&#x2019;re supposed to do. Should you pluck at this with your chopsticks? The meal may seem so very strange. True, you may be comfortable eating a cow, or a pig, or a chicken, yet when confronted with a yak or a swan or a cat, you do not reflexively think of sauces and marinades. The Chinese do however. And so you should eat whatever skips across your table. It is here where you can experience the complexity of China. And you will be rewarded. Very often, it is exceptionally good. And when it is not, it is undoubtedly interesting. And really, when traveling what more can one ask for. So go on. Eat as the locals do. However, should you find yourself confronted with a heaping platter of Cattle Penis with Garlic, you&#x2019;re on your own. <p></p> <b>2. </b>To really see China, go to the market. Any market will do. This is where China lives and breathes. It is here where you will find the sights, sounds and smells of China. And it is in a Chinese market where you will experience epic bargaining. The Chinese excel at bargaining. They live and breathe it. It is an art; it is a sport. It is, above all, nothing personal. If you do not parry back and forth, you will be regarded as a chump, a walking ATM machine, a carcass to be picked over. And so as you peruse the cabbage or consider the silk, be prepared to bargain. The objective, of course, is to obtain the <i>Chinese price</i>. You will, however, never actually receive the Chinese price. It is the holy grail for <i>laowais</i>--or foreigners--in China. Your status as a laowai is determined by how proximate your haggling gets you to the mythical Chinese price. But you will never obtain the Chinese price. Accept this. But if you&#x2019;re very, very good, and you bargain long and hard, and if you are lucky and catch your interlocutor on an off day, you may, just may, receive the <i>special price</i>. Consider yourself fortunate. <p></p> <b>3. </b>Travelers are often told to get off the beaten path, to take the road less traveled, to march to a different drum. You don't need to do this in China. The road well-traveled is a very fine road. The French Concession in Shanghai is splendid. The Forbidden City is a wonder of the world. So too the Terracotta Warriors in Xi'an. Indeed, the Chinese say so themselves. There is much to be seen in places that are often seen. And yet... China is not merely a country. It is not a place defined by sights. It is a world upon itself, a different planet even. And to see it--to feel it--means leaving that well-traveled road. And China is an excellent place for wandering. From the monasteries of Tibet to the rainforests of Yunnan Province and onward through the deserts of Xinjiang to the frozen tundra of Heilongjiang Province, China offers a vast kaleidoscope of people and terrain unlike anywhere else on Earth. This may seem intimidating to the China traveler. Will there be picture menus in the Taklamakan Desert? (No.) Is Visa accepted in Inner Mongolia? (Not likely.) Still, one should move beyond the Great Wall. And if you can manage to cross six lanes of traffic in Beijing, you can manage the slow train to Kunming. <p></p> <b>4. </b>Hell is a line in China. You are so forewarned. <p></p> <b>5. </b>Manners are important in China. How can this be, you wonder? You have, for instance, experienced a line in China. Your ribs have been pummeled. You have been trampled upon by grandmothers who are not more than four feet tall. You have learned, simply by queuing in the airport taxi line, what it is like to <i>eat bitter</i>, an evocative Chinese expression that conveys suffering. This does not seem upon first impression to be a country overly concerned with prim etiquette. But it is. True, hawking enormous, gelatinous loogies is perfectly acceptable in China. And a good belch is fine as well. And picking your teeth after dinner is a sign of urbane sophistication. But this does not mean that manners are not taken seriously in China. It&#x2019;s just that they are different in China. And so feel free to spit and burp, but do not even think of holding your chopsticks with your left hand. You will be regarded as an ill-mannered rube. So watch your manners in China. But learn them first. <br><br><b>J.

In the nineteenth century, an age without recorded music or television, this craze reached its apex. Pianos were everywhere: they swelled and shrank in the heat of the colonies, they were in every genteel home, in restaurants, on steamships, in the remote bars of the American west. Some of these pianos have become treasured family heirlooms, some have ended up as firewood. Others have led a more intinerant life, washing up in all sorts of strange places. Occasionally, these wandering pianos find their way to a secret, glass-roofed workshop in Paris where they are lovingly restored and sent off again by a French piano repairer with a passion for his job. When Thad Carhart discovered Luc and his hidden cache of pianos in the dusty repair shop on his street in Paris, his life changed. Having been constantly on the move between America and France, he had never owned his own piano. As he explored the Eldorado of second-hand uprights, grands, harpsichords and player pianos in Luc&#39;s atelier, talked to him about how they work and their history, and finally found the baby grand of his dreams, he rediscovered his deep love for this most magical of instruments.</p><p>T.

He now operates Woodleigh Nursery in New Zealand, where he grows an extensive range of hydrangeas. </p><p><b> Introduction </b></p><p> Hydrangeas are back in fashion after a few decades of being ignored. I find it hard to fathom why their popularity ever waned when they have so many wonderful qualities. Hydrangeas can be everything from formal shrubs in a courtyard to the visual highlight of a woodland garden. If you only have a paved area, or perhaps no garden at all, you can still enjoy hydrangeas in containers, maybe as window box subjects in an apartment, as a flowering potted plant on your dining table, or in vases around your living areas. No other plant is so diverse, so resilient or gives such pleasure for so long. </p><p> Over the years hydrangeas have won me over completely. From initially thinking of these plants as simply a fill-in shrub for summer color, I now see hidden depths and qualities in every one. This has driven me to some lengths to acquire new hydrangeas; everything from importing new varieties to extend the range available, to trekking through remote regions and abandoned homesteads looking for old faithfuls that have survived the centuries. The old house may fall down and disintegrate, but next to its foundations the ever-resilient hydrangea lives on. In this quest I've been extremely fortunate to have had the help of Corinne and Robert Mallet in France, Mat and Mary Kay Condon in the United States and Maurice Foster in England. All these enthusiasts have introduced me to new plants and sent me material. In New Zealand I was indebted to the late Os Blumhardt, who kept an old labeled collection of hydrangeas long after most people would have dug them out as "unfashionable." With Os's help I've been able to restore some long-lost varieties to Europe and the United States. I've also trekked around the world searching for wild hydrangeas in Korea, China, and the Himalayas. In Bhutan we found hydrangea plants as big as old pear trees. Not only were they large enough to climb, but on one occasion I observed langur monkeys among their branches, teasing a yapping dog below. </p><p> Someone in the United States (Martha Stewart, I think) decided in the year 1999 to call the hydrangea "the plant of the next millennium." I would be delighted to think these shrubs could be popular for the next thousand years, and with the never-ending range of colors and new cultivars available, there's no reason that this can't be prophetic. </p><p> The macrophylla type of hydrangea has a new-found popularity, primarily for two reasons. Firstly, the shrubs are now appreciated as exceptional providers of long-lasting cut flowers to decorate homes throughout the year. Secondly, for garden use, growers have discovered what are called "remontant" varieties capable of sending up new flower stalks all summer. In cold regions flowering canes may die in winter, or the early flowers are frosted and killed in spring, resulting in no flowers during the months following. Now, with the remontant types sending up new flower stems from below the frosted buds, even people in cold regions can enjoy hydrangeas in their garden. People like Michael Dirr, professor of horticulture at the University of Georgia in Atlanta, have set up extensive breeding programs to find hardier cultivars and ones resistant to common diseases. There has also been a huge increase in the number and popularity of <i>H. paniculata</i> and <i>H. quercifolia</i> as these are more reliably hardy and will therefore grow in more regions of the country. This has encouraged nurserymen to look for new clones of these species and has given us some splendid new varieties to grace our gardens -- doubles, pinks and bicolored forms, all adding to the hydrangea's appeal. </p><p> In Japan, the home of many hydrangeas, the shrubs were long seen as inconstant because they can change color depending on the soil type in which they grow.

Complementing the selection of plays is an illuminating group of essays that captures Wilder&#x2019;s reflections on his plays and contains a revealing epistolary account of the film adaptation of&nbsp;<i>Our Town</i>.<br><br>This volume also includes material never before published: scenes from&nbsp;<i>The Emporium</i>, an ambitious unfinished play that, emerging out of Wilder&#x2019;s intense engagement with existentialist philosophy in the postwar years, imagines a Kafkaesque department store whose enigmatic activities are as inscrutable as the mysteries of life itself; and the complete screenplay Wilder wrote for Alfred Hitchcock&#x2019;s film&nbsp;<i>Shadow of a Doubt</i>&nbsp;just before reporting for military service in 1942. Although faithful to the spirit of the film, the screenplay presented here restores Wilder&#x2019;s original dialogue, some of which (to Wilder&#x2019;s dismay) was altered for the movie. A study of family life, youthful illusions, and the desperation of a criminal on the run, the&nbsp;<i>Shadow of a Doubt</i>&nbsp;screenplay is a masterful exhibition of the art of suspense and taut dramatic storytelling, and is an essential part of Wilder&#x2019;s oeuvre.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

The Aran Islands, in Galway Bay off the west coast of Ireland, are a unique geological and cultural landscape, and for centuries their stark beauty and their inhabitants&#x2019; traditional way of life have attracted pilgrims from abroad. After a visit with his wife in 1972, Tim Robinson moved to the islands, where he started making maps and gathering stories, eventually developing the idea for a cosmic history of �rainn, the largest of the three islands. <i>Pilgrimage</i> is the first of two volumes that make up <i>Stones of Aran</i>, in which Robinson maps the length and breadth of �rainn. Here he circles the entire island, following a clockwise, sunwise path in quest of the &#x201c;good step,&#x201d; in which walking itself becomes a form of attention and contemplation.<br><br>Like Annie Dillard&#x2019;s <i>Pilgrim at Tinker Creek</i> and Bruce Chatwin&#x2019;s <i>In Patagonia</i>, <i>Stones of Aran</i> is not only a meticulous and mesmerizing study of place but an entrancing and altogether unclassifiable work of literature. Robinson explores Aran in both its elemental and mythical dimensions, taking us deep into the island&#x2019;s folklore, wildlife, names, habitations, and natural and human histories.

All of the poems here, whether sonnet, mesostic, or deconstructed blues, exhibit a formal flair. They speak to the changes we have experienced as a society in the last few decades&#x2015;changes that often challenge our past strategies for resisting racism and, for African Americans, ways of relating to one another. The poems embrace a formal ambiguity that echoes the uncertainty these shifts produce, while reveling in language play that enables readers to "laugh to keep from crying." They move through nostalgia, even as they insist on being alive to the present and point longingly towards possible futures.

Douglas, <i>Los Angeles Review</i></p><p>"Both spare and lyrical, Shockley's poems often begin with an active interrogation of received poetic forms and practices, such as capitalization.

She possesses that rare combination of grace and subversiveness. As a poem like 'x marks the spot' demonstrates, she elegantly wrestles with/against staid notions of culture, identity and influence.

Organized around an historical reconstruction of the great anthropological controversy over doctrines of virgin birth, the book argues that the allegation a great deal about European colonial discourse and little if anything about indigenous beliefs. By means of an Australian example, the book shows not only that the alleged ignorance was an artifact of the anthropological theory that produced it, but also that the anthropology was an artifact of the anthropological theory that produced it, but also that the anthropology concerned has been closely tied into both the historical dispossession and the continuing oppression of native peoples. The author explores the links between metropolitan anthropological theory and local colonial politics from the 19th century up to the present, settler colonialism, and the ideological and sexual regimes that characterize it.</p><p></p><h2>Diviner (Dragons of Starlight)</h2><p><p>For years, tales of</p><p><strong>DRAGONS</strong></p><p>from another world kidnapping and enslaving humans have been circulating in Jason Masters&#x2019; world, while for a slave girl named Koren, the stories of a human world seem pure myth.

In an outstanding analysis, Trachtenberg eloquently articulates how the art of photography has both followed and shaped the course of American history, and how images captured decades ago provocatively illuminate the present.</p></p><p><p><b>Alan Trachtenberg</b>, Neil Gray, Jr., Professor of English and American Studies at Yale University, is the author of <i>The Incorporation of America: Culture </i><i>and Society in the Gilded Age</i>.</p>Trachtenberg's sophisticated discussion finds in American photographs a way of reading the past--"the past as culture, as ways of thinking and feeling, as experience." For this study he considers images originally edited as albums, books, or photo-stories. In such works as Mathew Brady's Gallery of Illustrious Americans, the Civil War albums of Alexander Gardner and George Barnard, Timothy O'Sullivan's Western survey photographs, Lewis Hine's social work projects and texts, and Walker Evans's American Photographs, he sees photographers trying to make sense of their society while seeking to create a role for photography as an American art. This impressive analysis, which employs social, cultural, and political history as well as art criticism, is highly recommended for American studies and photography collections.

The discovery of skeletal remains still bearing a long dark braid of hair opens deep wounds among the Native Americans who live on Wyoming's Wind River reservation. Arapaho attorney Vicky Holden's efforts to identify the woman, apparently a murder victim, cause tension with her love interest and law partner, Adam Lone Eagle, driving her to enlist the aid of their friend Fr. John O'Malley. A rash of threats and the murder of a woman Vicky questioned confirms her suspicions that members of a 1970s activist group, the American Indian Movement, are still on the rez and somehow involved in all the happenings. Bringing her trademark western flair to nonstop action, Coel keeps danger hanging over Vicky's head as she follows a trail of clues to their startling conclusion. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Through careful analysis of organization, training, and tactical doctrine, each essay seeks to explain the strengths and weaknesses evidenced by the outcome of the first significant engagement or campaign of the war. The concluding essay sets out to synthesize the findings and to discover whether or not American first battles manifest a characteristic "rhythm."<br><br><i>America's First Battles</i> provides a novel and intellectually challenging view of how America has prepared for war and how operations and tactics have changed over time. The thrust of the book&#x2014;the emphasis on operational history&#x2014;is at the forefront of scholarly activity in military history.</p><p>Lieutenant Colonel Charles E. Heller is Chief of Mobilization Requirements, Operation, and Training at the Army Reserve Personnel Center. <p>Brigadier General William A.

Each chapter treats a single battle and is written by a historian with acknowledged specialization in that period of military history. These evaluations are stimulating, comparable pictures for students of general history, military history, and political-military relationships."&#x2014;<b><i>Choice</i></b></p><p>"Must reading for the serious student of history, whether military or civilian."&#x2014;<b><i>Military Review</i></b></p><p>"Not just soldiers and historians should read it, but all thoughtful Americans, even those with a visceral dislike for anything military."&#x2014;<b><i>The Historian</i></b><br><br>"A brilliantly conceived and executed collection of essays written by some of the country&#x2019;s foremost military historians. <i>America&#x2019;s First Battles</i> achieves that rare feat of combining genuine reading enjoyment with superb scholarship. While portraying the human drama inherent on the battlefield with the flair of novelists, the authors also masterfully integrate the sustained exploration of the effects that command and control procedures, prewar doctrine, Army readiness, and the war&#x2019;s political context can have on first battles (which in turn can have such a profound impact that they often shape a war&#x2019;s entire course). Nothing quite like this book exists in the literature. It automatically goes to the top of the &#x2018;must read&#x2019; list for anyone interested in America&#x2019;s military past&#x2014;and, perhaps, its future."&#x2014;<b>Peter Maslowski</b>, coauthor of <i>For the Common Defense</i></p><p>"I can rave about this book. In contrast to the typical narrative focused on the leaders, these accounts go into depth on each battle. The authors not only tell the stories fully but also make excellent analyses.

Many of you have traveled this journey with me and grown to know and love the people of Harmony.</p><p>Now we&#x2019;re going all the way back to the beginning, to the start of the town. For those of you who read the series, you&#x2019;ll love knowing how it all started. For those who haven&#x2019;t visited Harmony yet, you&#x2019;ll be stepping into a community at the birth of not only a town, but of friendships that will last for lifetimes. If you enjoy this tale, you might just stay awhile and read the rest of my stories.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve always loved historicals. For me, early heroes in Texas always walk off the pages and into my heart.</p><p>I think you&#x2019;ll feel that way about Clint Truman, who believes he doesn&#x2019;t have enough heart left to break; and Gillian Matheson, who has loved one woman since he first saw her; and, of course, Patrick McAllen, who is young enough to believe that love comes easy.</p><p>Many books I write take on a life of their own. In this one I felt like I was meeting these men and their wives, not making them up. Truman stepped onto the pages with a stubbornness that his descendants had in later books: Matheson&#x2019;s strong need to protect and help others is deeply rooted, and Patrick&#x2019;s laughter shows through in every scene in which he appears.</p><p>So climb into the covered wagon and come along with me to Texas. I promise, this story will keep you reading long into the night.</p><p>With love,</p><p>Jodi Thomas</p><p></p><p></p><p>Prologue</p><p>DEAD OF WINTER</p><p>Harmon Ely limped out of the trading post he&#x2019;d built where two streams crossed in the panhandle of Texas. He&#x2019;d suffered through a fire that burned his first building to the ground, two robberies, and a dozen winter storms that almost froze him out.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a good ten years, Davy.&#x201d; He grinned at the hairy yellow dog a few feet away.</p><p>The hound looked up at Harmon with sad eyes that called the old man a liar.</p><p>Harmon laughed. &#x201c;I know you&#x2019;re gonna be surprised, but I figure it&#x2019;s about time we had a little company, and I don&#x2019;t mean the beef herders and saddle tramps I usually see. I want families, kids playing around the place, and a town growing up on all this land I bought after the war.&#x201d;</p><p>The old mutt named after Davy Crockett still didn&#x2019;t look interested.</p><p>Harmon lifted a board as high as he could and hammered it up on the front of his store like it was a picture. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been thinking. We&#x2019;ll need a lawman, and someone who knows a thing or two about building a town, and a carpenter to carry it all out. I wouldn&#x2019;t mind having a few cooks and kids and throw in a schoolmarm to teach them what&#x2019;s right and a preacher to make them feel guilty if they don&#x2019;t follow along.&#x201d;</p><p>Davy spread out like a rug on the slice of sun-warmed porch.</p><p>Harmon lifted a can of paint. Slowly, he wrote <i>Population</i> across the top of the sign. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care how long it takes, I&#x2019;m gonna have me a town.&#x201d;</p><p>In the middle of the sign, he painted a big number 1. Then down at the bottom he added in smaller letters, <i>and one dog</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;A town,&#x201d; he said to himself, since Davy was snoring, &#x201c;that even my family would want to come to. A nice place where folks will pass by and say, &#x2018;There&#x2019;s old Harmon Ely&#x2019;s town.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>FEBRUARY<br>HUNTSVILLE, TEXAS</p><p>Clint Truman hit the floor so hard his teeth rattled, but, as always, he didn&#x2019;t have the sense to stay down. He came up swinging, ready for another round.</p><p>The next hard blow from the miner he&#x2019;d decided to fight sent him flying through the saloon&#x2019;s swinging doors and into the muddy street. He slid several feet, picking up horse shit along with the mud as he dug up the road. Then he just lay still, letting the rain beat on him for a while.</p><p>When he tried to straighten, a heavy boot landed on his chest, holding him down like a boulder. Clint stared up, but the rain and clouds offered him only a shadow of the man above him. A wide shadow.</p><p>&#x201c;Evening, Truman.&#x201d; Sheriff Lightstone&#x2019;s voice matched his three hundred pound body: big and frightening. &#x201c;You drunk enough to listen to me now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Soon as I finish the fight, Sheriff,&#x201d; Clint promised.</p><p>&#x201c;The fight&#x2019;s over.&#x201d; Lightstone lifted the gun belt that circled his ample waist. &#x201c;We need to talk, Truman, before you kill someone and I have to arrest you. Now, we can do it here with you in the mud, or we can do it with you behind bars, but we&#x2019;re going to have a talk.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hell,&#x201d; Clint said, hating both choices. &#x201c;How about you buy me a cup of coffee before you get into telling me how to live my life?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fair enough, but clean up first. Between the blood and the mud, there ain&#x2019;t an inch of you left unaffected. I&#x2019;m tired of standing in this drizzle anyway. You&#x2019;ve got ten minutes to meet me at Maggie&#x2019;s. If you don&#x2019;t pass her inspection to get in, I&#x2019;m putting you in jail and letting you dry out until the mud flakes off and the bleeding scabs over.&#x201d;</p><p>Clint stood and watched the sheriff head toward the only caf� willing to serve drunks in Huntsville, Texas. He hated being bossed around, and he wasn&#x2019;t trying to kill himself by fighting. He just had a ton of anger built up in him and needed to get it out. In a town like Huntsville someone was always looking for a good fight.</p><p>Walking over to the horse trough, he dunked his head in and shook, guessing the horses wouldn&#x2019;t appreciate him bloodying the water. He pulled the plug at the bottom of the trough and let water run out into the river already flowing in the street.</p><p>Thunder rumbled and the sky dumped buckets down on him. Clint turned his head up and took the full blast. &#x201c;Give it your best shot!&#x201d; he yelled, waiting for the lightning. Life couldn&#x2019;t get any more painful. He probably wouldn&#x2019;t feel a direct hit.</p><p>A kid of about ten ran past him, bumping into his outstretched arm. &#x201c;Sorry, mister,&#x201d; he shouted over the storm. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you notice it&#x2019;s raining?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hell,&#x201d; Clint answered. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been raining all my life.&#x201d;</p><p>He replaced the plug in the trough, then walked to a bench outside the saloon and lifted his saddlebags from where he&#x2019;d left them three hours and several drinks ago. He might not have the sense to come out of the rain, but at least he&#x2019;d left his horse in the barn.</p><p>Reluctantly, Clint headed to the back door of Maggie&#x2019;s place. Once inside the mudroom, he stripped off his shirt and dried with a towel the owner tossed him.</p><p>Maggie watched from the doorway of the kitchen as he cleaned up. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re one hunk of a man, Clint Truman. If you ever gave up fighting and turned to loving, you&#x2019;d make some woman very happy.&#x201d; Her inspection wasn&#x2019;t shy. &#x201c;That scar running across your hand, or the one on your jaw, don&#x2019;t take nothing away from that perfect body. Broad shoulders, slim waist and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She grinned. &#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t mind if you turned around so I could finish my description.&#x201d;</p><p>He growled at her.</p><p>Maggie held up her hands and tried her best to look innocent. &#x201c;Just making notes to pass along to some woman looking for a new lover.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no more loving left in me, Maggie.&#x201d; He said the words as if he were swearing. &#x201c;You mind turning around while I change my pants?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not a chance. An old widow like me don&#x2019;t get to see a full-grown man strip but a few times, and I&#x2019;m not missing this opportunity. My first husband used to wash in the creek and come back to the house naked, but he was so hairy I thought he was a bear heading my way half the time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You got anything to drink, Maggie?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; She stepped away and he exchanged soaked trousers for damp ones from his bag.</p><p>When she returned she handed him a cup of coffee, and he frowned.</p><p>&#x201c;Trust me, honey, you need this. That bull of a sheriff is out front waiting and he don&#x2019;t look happy.&#x201d;</p><p>Clint downed half of the hot liquid that tasted more like the mud outside than coffee. He&#x2019;d known this talk with the sheriff was coming, so he might as well get it over with.</p><p>Thanking Maggie for the towel and the coffee, Clint stepped through the kitchen door to the caf�. Sure enough, Lightstone sat by the window staring out at his town.</p><p>Clint took the seat across from him without saying a word.</p><p>&#x201c;You eat today?&#x201d; the sheriff asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a kid. I don&#x2019;t need mothering,&#x201d; Clint snapped. At thirty he&#x2019;d about decided he didn&#x2019;t need anything from anyone.</p><p>&#x201c;You ever wear anything but black?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. Why the hell do you care?&#x201d; Clint needed a drink. He had a feeling this wasn&#x2019;t going to go well.</p><p>The sheriff ignored his comment. &#x201c;I heard you fought with Terry&#x2019;s Texas Rangers during the war. Some say you were a crack shot. Maybe even the best in the South.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Some talk too much. Most of what I shot was game for dinner. I don&#x2019;t want to talk about the war. Wasted years. We lost, you know. The whole damn country lost.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know how you feel. I thought I was fighting for Texas. For rights, then found out later it was all about slavery. By then, it was too late and I was mostly just fighting to stay alive.&#x201d; He stared down at his cup as if looking for the answer. &#x201c;What&#x2019;d you do when you got home?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I drifted for a while, trying to shake ghosts following me. My folks kept a little farm going during the war, so I finally settled there. I helped them out for a few years until they passed on. Then, I thought I&#x2019;d marry and start a family.&#x201d; Clint didn&#x2019;t go on. He couldn&#x2019;t. The memory of his two little girls crying still haunted his dreams.</p><p>Lightstone waited for a while then added, &#x201c;I know enough to fill in the details, Truman. I heard your wife and daughters died a few years ago of the fever. Folks say you burned the house and the barns the morning after you buried them.&#x201d;</p><p>Clint didn&#x2019;t comment. He felt like his whole life was simply acts in a play, and some days he didn&#x2019;t want to step on the stage. Sometimes he thought the ache to feel his wife, Mary, by his side would collapse his chest, or the need to run his hand over one of his daughters&#x2019; curly hair would almost take him to his knees. They were gone so fast, like his parents and all the boys he&#x2019;d joined up with to go to war. Some nights, in his nightmares, he felt like a time traveler going back to them all. They&#x2019;d smile at him and wave, then curl up and die like dried leaves caught in a campfire.</p><p>Clint took a long drink of his coffee and waited for the sheriff&#x2019;s lecture. He&#x2019;d heard it before: different people, different towns. If he had enough caring left in him to change, he would try one more time, but he no longer saw the point.</p><p>&#x201c;Truman,&#x201d; the sheriff began. &#x201c;I need your help with a matter.&#x201d;</p><p>Clint raised an eyebrow. He hadn&#x2019;t expected the sheriff would want a favor. Lightstone was only passable nice to him on a good day, and the huge man had very few of them in a town like Huntsville.</p><p>&#x201c;Now, hear me out before you decide. Promise. This is me asking for something, not me telling you what to do. You make up your own mind.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All right. I&#x2019;ll hear you out,&#x201d; Clint answered. He didn&#x2019;t plan to walk back over to the saloon until the rain let up anyway. He had no other clothes to change into.</p><p>Lightstone leaned back. &#x201c;I got a friend I fought with during the war who wants to build a town. He&#x2019;s been running a trading post up in the wild part of Texas where the Indian Wars have been going on for ten years. He makes good money, thanks to the cattle drives coming through and crazy settlers who wanted to move that far north, but he wants more. He wants to have a community. He says his wife refused to go with him because that part of the state is too wild. Thanks to Colonel McKenzie and a new fort moving in, it may be settling down.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How does this affect me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My friend is a good businessman, but the war left him crippled up. He&#x2019;s been robbed several times, and once they shot him and left him for dead. If he&#x2019;s going to do this, he&#x2019;ll need someone good with a gun working for him. I&#x2019;ve heard, even if you don&#x2019;t usually wear a gun belt, that there is no better shot in the state.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a hired gun, Sheriff. Not interested.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, you wouldn&#x2019;t be that. He&#x2019;s offering every man who comes to work for him forty acres and a house to live in. If you stay two years, he&#x2019;ll deed the place over to you. He&#x2019;ll pay a fair wage and you help him build the town. A real town where folks can walk the streets without worrying about being robbed or shot.&#x201d;</p><p>Clint was low on money and knew he&#x2019;d have to look for a job soon, but he never planned to settle anywhere again. He might get attached to folks if he did that, and he never, ever planned to let that happen again. Signing on to be his friend or loved one was a death warrant.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d be hauling supplies and running cattle and who knows what else, but you&#x2019;d also carry a gun. You&#x2019;d be protecting hardworking folks and running off those who are looking for trouble. This time you&#x2019;d be fighting to keep people alive. That part of Texas has very little law of any kind. Trouble will ride in at full gallop more than once over two years, I&#x2019;m guessing. You&#x2019;ll earn that house and land.&#x201d;</p><p>Lightstone leaned halfway across the table and yelled for Maggie to bring them a couple of meals. He didn&#x2019;t have to say more; she only served one choice a day.</p><p>She yelled that he needed to stop yelling at her.</p><p>The sheriff smiled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d marry that woman if she&#x2019;d have me, but she says four husbands were enough.&#x201d;</p><p>Clint didn&#x2019;t want to picture the two in bed, but the image came all the same. Both were built wide and thick. Maggie told him once that she was simply big-boned. Proof of dinosaurs, he remembered thinking at the time. If she and the sheriff ever did get together and make love, they&#x2019;d shake the house.</p><p>Lightstone drew him back to the conversation. &#x201c;What have you got to lose? The trip north, even if you decided not to stay, would do you good.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All right. I&#x2019;ll go.&#x201d; Clint had nothing else to do anyway. He could be packed in an hour. &#x201c;But I make no promises that I&#x2019;ll stay two years.&#x201d;</p><p>The sheriff nodded as if they&#x2019;d made a bargain. &#x201c;Oh, I forgot, you have to take one thing with you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; He was thinking maybe his own horse, or rifle.</p><p>The sheriff smiled and added, &#x201c;A wife.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>HUNTSVILLE, TEXAS</p><p>Clint Truman finally sobered up enough to realize just how crazy the sheriff&#x2019;s plan was. He didn&#x2019;t mind traveling across the state to look for work, but picking a wife from the women being released from prison tonight was loco.</p><p>Yet somehow, here he was standing next to a mountain of a lawman waiting for the prison gates to open.</p><p>Sheriff Lightstone stood close, probably making sure he didn&#x2019;t run. The night seemed smoky with low clouds, and so much moisture lingered in the air Clint could feel it on his face.</p><p>&#x201c;Now it&#x2019;s not that hard, Clint. I&#x2019;ve seen fellows do this before. Last month a man I&#x2019;ve known for years met a little pickpocket outside these gates. He never had much luck with women, but they talked all night, then at dawn woke up a preacher. She had to pay, of course. Somehow my old friend couldn&#x2019;t find his money.&#x201d;</p><p>Clint didn&#x2019;t laugh. He had no idea if the sheriff was telling the truth or making a joke.</p><p>&#x201c;Way I see it,&#x201d; Lightsto...</p></p><h2>The Politically Incorrect Guide to Darwinism and Intelligent Design</h2><p>Why Darwinism like Marxism and Freudianism before it is headed for extinction<br>In the 1925 Scopes trial, the American Civil Liberties Union sued to allow the teaching of Darwin&#x2019;s theory of evolution in public schools. Seventy-five years later, in Kitzmiller v. Dover, the ACLU sued to prevent the teaching of an alternative to Darwin&#x2019;s theory known as "Intelligent Design" and won. Why did the ACLU turn from defending the free-speech rights of Darwinists to silencing their opponents? Jonathan Wells reveals that, for today&#x2019;s Darwinists, there may be no other choice: unable to fend off growing challenges from scientists, or to compete with rival theories better adapted to the latest evidence, Darwinism like Marxism and Freudianism before it is simply unfit to survive.<br> <br>Wells begins by explaining the basic tenets of Darwinism, and the evidence both for and against it. He reveals, for instance, that the fossil record, which according to Darwin should be teeming with "transitional" fossils showing the development of one species to the next, so far hasn&#x2019;t produced a single incontestable example. On the other hand, certain well-documented aspects of the fossil record such as the Cambrian explosion, in which innumerable new species suddenly appeared fully formed directly contradict Darwin&#x2019;s theory. Wells also shows how most of the other "evidence" for evolution including textbook "icons" such as peppered moths, Darwin&#x2019;s finches, Haeckel&#x2019;s embryos, and the Tree of Life has been exaggerated, distorted . . . and even faked.<br> <br>Wells then turns to the theory of intelligent design (ID), the idea that some features of the natural world, such as the internal machinery of cells, are too "irreducibly complex" to have resulted from unguided natural processes alone. In clear-cut layman&#x2019;s language, he reveals the growing evidence for ID coming out of scientific specialties from microbiology to astrophysics. As Wells explains, religion does play a role in the debate over Darwin though not in the way evolutionists claim. Wells shows how Darwin reasoned that evolution is true because divine creation "must" be false a theological assumption oddly out of place in a scientific debate. In other words, Darwinists&#x2019; materialistic, atheistic assumptions rule out any theories but their own, and account for their willingness to explain away the evidence or lack of it.<br> <br>Darwin is an emperor who has no clothes but it takes a brave man to say so. Jonathan Wells, a microbiologist with two Ph.D.s (from Berkeley and Yale), is that brave man. Most textbooks on evolution are written by Darwinists with an ideological ax to grind. Brave dissidents qualified scientists who try to teach or write about intelligent design are silenced and sent to the academic gulag. But fear not: Jonathan Wells is a liberator. He unmasks the truth about Darwinism why it is wrong and what the real evidence is. He also supplies a revealing list of "Books You&#x2019;re Not Supposed to Read" (as far as the Darwinists are concerned) and puts at your fingertips all the evidence you need to challenge the most closed-minded Darwinist.</p><p>Jonathan Wells is a Senior Fellow at the Discovery Institute in Seattle, Washington. He holds a Ph.D. in biology from the University of California at Berkeley and a Ph.D. in theology from Yale University. He is the author of Icons of Evolution: Why Much of What We Teach about Evolution Is Wrong (Regnery) and is currently doing intelligent design&#x2013;related scientific research.</p><h2>Authenticity: A Biblical Theology of Discernment</h2><p><p>Most people assume that the way to mend divisions and factions in our world - marriages, parishes, dioceses, religious orders - is to engage in civil discussions, attend local, regional or national meetings, draw up committee reports and recommendations. To a point this may help, but sad experience makes clear that these approaches alone never heal the polarization problems which plague our civil and ecclesial life.</p><p>The Biblical therapy is radically different - and it achieves results. This book explores the divine strategy in detail. Research discovers in Scripture 40 or 50 themes that bear on discovering truth and recognizing that it has been solidly found. We learn how we discern whether we are being led by the Holy Spirit or by our own unredeemed inclinations and desires, whether it is the spirit of God or the prince of darkness that is operating in our disagreements and programs. We find in these themes clear responses to key questions:</p><p>� Why are there divisions and factions in the Church?</p><p>� How are these polarizations to be healed?</p><p>� What are the sure signs that some people have truth, while others are in error?</p><p>� What are the conditions for finding and maintaining a shared vision in marriage,</p><p>parishes, dioceses, religious orders, the universal Church?</p></p><p>Fr.

But as he says: "no description of me is truly complete without saying I'm a Canadian." He has often winked and nodded to Canada in his outrageously accomplished body of work, but now he turns the spotlight full-beam on his homeland.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His hilarious and heartfelt new book is part memoir, part history and pure entertainment. It is Mike Myers' funny and thoughtful analysis of what makes Canada Canada, Canadians Canadians and what being Canadian has always meant to him. His relationship with his home and native land continues to deepen and grow, he says. In fact, American friends have actually accused him of <i>enjoying</i> being Canadian&#x2014;and he's happy to plead guilty as charged.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A true patriot who happens to be an expatriate, Myers is in a unique position to explore Canada from within and without. With this, his first book, Mike brings his love for Canada to the fore at a time when the country is once again looking ahead with hope and national pride. <i>Canada</i> is a wholly subjective account of Mike's Canadian experience. Mike writes, "Some might say, 'Why didn't you include this or that?' I say there are 35 million stories waiting to be told in this country, and my book is only one of them."<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This beautifully designed book is illustrated in colour (and <i>not</i> color) throughout, and its visual treasures include personal photographs and Canadiana from the author's own collection. Published in the lead-up to the 2017 sesquicentennial, this is Mike Myers' birthday gift to his fellow Canadians. Or as he puts it: "In 1967, Canada turned one hundred.&nbsp;Canadians all across the country made Centennial projects.&nbsp;This book is my Centennial Project. I'm handing it in a little late.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Sorry."</p><p>MIKE MYERS is one of the most multi�faceted performers of his generation. As an actor, writer and producer he has brought an astonishing array of memorable characters to life in film and television, including Wayne Campbell, Austin Powers, Dr. Evil and Shrek. In 2013, he made his directorial debut with the critically acclaimed documentary <i>Supermensch: The Legend of Shep Gordon, </i>which earned an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Arts and Culture Programming.

The book focuses on the impact that Canadian culture&#x2014;from CBC to the Toronto Maple Lears to Expo 67&#x2014;had on Myers' early life, and the ways it still influences him today. Add references to the all-Canadian traits of good manners, fairness, inclusivity, self-depreciation and mellowness, and you've got Myers' personal picture of Canada." &#x2014;<i>Canadian Living</i></p><h2>The Cinnamon Peeler: Selected Poems</h2><p>Michael Ondaatje&#x2019;s new selected poems, <i>The Cinnamon Peeler</i>, brings together poems written between 1963 and 1990, including work from his most recent collection, <i>Secular Love</i>.

Everyone dislikes death but not the things conducive to death"). The first selection, "Anthology on the Cultivation of Realization," is a vivid assortment of reflections taking up nearly half the book's text; it is long but fascinating.

David Miller, a leading expositor and critic of Popper's work, has chosen thirty selections that illustrate the profundity and originality of his ideas and their applicability to current intellectual and social problems.

What do historians do? Where do their explorations take them? What is the impact of the digital age on historical research?</p><br><br><p>In an affable style, Nigel A. Raab answers these questions for those intrigued by the past. Each chapter describes a specific aspect of "doing history," beginning in the physical spaces of archives and libraries around the globe. Readers are then introduced to the sources&#x2014;texts, oral interviews, films, and objects&#x2014;which historians interpret. Raab points out that historians do not work alone with their materials; rather, archivists, librarians, and others play a crucial role in what he calls the web of the historian's work. Readers will also learn about the skill set imparted to those pursuing a historical education. In the final chapter, Raab brings all these themes together to demonstrate the value of the historian in the contemporary world.</p></p><p><b>Nigel A.

The great strength of this book is the acknowledgment that historians never really work in isolation. (<i>Left History</i>)<br><br>Nigel A. Raab's engaging style, starting with his own admission of uncertainty as a student, and his undisguised passion for history will be both a comfort and an inspiration for those who are looking for direction.

It addresses the need for parents and educators to better understand the Montessori philosophy and to embrace it as a means to solve the problems inherent in the traditional structure of education in the United States. Despite the fact that Dr. Maria Montessori created this method over 100 years ago, most of her discoveries about how children learn and the effect of their environment on their developing brains have only recently been validated by current technology and specialists in brain development. These recent discoveries and the real-world success of numerous high-profile Montessori-educated entrepreneurs have helped the popularity of this educational philosophy. Turning Education Inside-Out: Confessions of a Montessori Principal shows the impact that the Montessori experience has on the developing child, clears up misconceptions about exactly what Montessori is, and helps prospective parents determine if Montessori is right for their child. Montessori educators will also find the author&#39;s insights into the challenges of successfully implementing the Montessori philosophy into the classroom and school to be helpful in their own journey.</p><p>Judy Dempsey is the owner and principal of Summit-Questa Montessori School in Davie, Florida&#x2014;a Montessori school on 10 acres for students from the age of three through the 8th grade.

Appropriate for all levels of expertise, the book provides the knowledge and tools required to conduct a human error analysis of accidents, regardless of operational setting (i.e. military, commercial, or general aviation). The book contains a complete description of the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS), which incorporates James Reason&#39;s model of latent and active failures as a foundation. Widely disseminated among military and civilian organizations, HFACS encompasses all aspects of human error, including the conditions of operators and elements of supervisory and organizational failure. It attracts a very broad readership. Specifically, the book serves as the main textbook for a course in aviation accident investigation taught by one of the authors at the University of Illinois. This book will also be used in courses designed for military safety officers and flight surgeons in the U.S. Navy, Army and the Canadian Defense Force, who currently utilize the HFACS system during aviation accident investigations. Additionally, the book has been incorporated into the popular workshop on accident analysis and prevention provided by the authors at several professional conferences world-wide. The book is also targeted for students attending Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University which has satellite campuses throughout the world and offers a course in human factors accident investigation for many of its majors. In addition, the book will be incorporated into courses offered by Transportation Safety International and the Southern California Safety Institute. Finally, this book serves as an excellent reference guide for many safety professionals and investigators already in the field.</p><p>Dr. Shappell is an internationally renowned expert and a highly sought after consultant and speaker in the fields of human factors, systems safety, error management, and accident investigation. He formerly served as Human Factors Branch Chief at the U.S. Naval Safety Center and as a human factors accident investigation consultant for the Joint Service Safety Chiefs. Prior to the Naval Safety Center, he served as the Force Aerospace Psychologist for the Commander, Naval Air Forces, U.S. Atlantic Fleet. His work experiences also include serving as the Human Factors Research Branch Manager at the Civil Aerospace Medical Institute of the Federal Aviation Administration in Oklahoma City, OK.

He is a board certified human factors professional and the past-president of the Aerospace Human Factors Association.'Bridging the gap between system safety theory and practice, this book provides a clear, comprehensive, field-tested framework to assist aviation safety professionals with investigating, analyzing, and assessing the impact of human error in aviation accidents and incidents. A 'must-read' for all interested in causal factor analysis!' Dr. James T. Luxhoj, Rutgers University, USA '...it is the training in human error analysis using HFACS that has enabled our Naval Flight Surgeons to serve as the human factors experts...' Captain James R. Fraser, M.D., Command Surgeon, Naval Safety Center, Norfolk, Virginia. 'This book is essential reading for all safety professionals, investigators and analysts. Time tested results of aircraft mishap analysis reveal that 80% of all mishaps have human factors as a significant contributing causal factor. These diverse factors have been identified but until now have been difficult to classify in a simple schema that could be used by operators, investigators or human error professionals. This sentinel work, that Dr's Wiegmann and Shappell have generated based upon Reason's model for human error, now provides an elegant tool for not only analysis and classification of the disparate data elements but also provides a frame work to build our intervention strategies around.' Captain Nicholas Webster, MD, MPH, Aeromedical Safety Professional '...the book should be required reading for any journalist expected to cover air accidents. ...it contains a wealth of insight and it will be a useful addition to the bookshelf of anyone with an interest in aviation safety. ' Navigation News Jan 04 'This is a seriously informative and provocative text which deserves a wide readership among all aviation safety professionals and concerned individuals and organisations in the military forces and general travelling public.'

First coined by Richard Dawkins in <em>The Selfish Gene</em>, a meme is any idea, behavior, or skill that can be transferred from one person to another by imitation: stories, fashions, inventions, recipes, songs, ways of plowing a field or throwing a baseball or making a sculpture. The meme is also one of the most important--and controversial--concepts to emerge since <em>The Origin of the Species</em> appeared nearly 150 years ago.<br> In <em>The Meme Machine</em> Susan Blackmore boldly asserts: "Just as the design of our bodies can be understood only in terms of natural selection, so the design of our minds can be understood only in terms of memetic selection." Indeed, Blackmore shows that once our distant ancestors acquired the crucial ability to imitate, a second kind of natural selection began, a survival of the fittest amongst competing ideas and behaviors. Ideas and behaviors that proved most adaptive--making tools, for example, or using language--survived and flourished, replicating themselves in as many minds as possible. These memes then passed themselves on from generation to generation by helping to ensure that the genes of those who acquired them also survived and reproduced. Applying this theory to many aspects of human life, Blackmore offers brilliant explanations for why we live in cities, why we talk so much, why we can't stop thinking, why we behave altruistically, how we choose our mates, and much more.<br> With controversial implications for our religious beliefs, our free will, our very sense of "self," <em>The Meme Machine</em> offers a provocative theory everyone will soon be talking about.<br></p><p>In <i>The Selfish Gene</i>, Richard Dawkins proposed the concept of the <i>meme</i> as a unit of culture, spread by imitation. Now Dawkins himself says of Susan Blackmore: <p> </p><blockquote> Showing greater courage and intellectual <i>chutzpah</i> than I have ever aspired to, she deploys her memetic forces in a brave--do not think foolhardy until you have read it--assault on the deepest questions of all: What is a self? What am I? Where am I? ... Any theory deserves to be given its best shot, and that is what Susan Blackmore has given the theory of the meme. </blockquote><p> Blackmore is a parapsychologist who rejects the paranormal, a skeptical investigator of near-death experiences, and a practitioner of Zen. Her explanation of the science of the meme (memetics) is rigorously Darwinian. Because she is a careful thinker (though by no means dull or conventional), the reader ends up with a good idea of what memetics explains well and what it doesn't, and with many ideas about how it can be tested--the very hallmark of an excellent science book. Blackmore's discussion of the "memeplexes" of religion and of the self are sure to be controversial, but she is (as Dawkins says) enormously honest and brave to make a connection between scientific ideas and how one should live one's life. <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i></p><br><strong>Susan Blackmore</strong> is a Lecturer in the School of Psychology, University of the West of England.

It is aimed at advanced undergraduate and graduate students who will find it not only highly readable but replete with illustrations carefully selected to help stimulate the student's visual understanding of geometry. The text features an abundance of problems, most of which are simple enough for class use, and often convey an interesting geometrical fact. A selection of more difficult problems has been included to challenge the ambitious student.<br>Written by a noted mathematician and historian of mathematics, this volume presents the fundamental conceptions of the theory of curves and surfaces and applies them to a number of examples. Dr. Struik has enhanced the treatment with copious historical, biographical, and bibliographical references that place the theory in context and encourage the student to consult original sources and discover additional important ideas there.<br>For this second edition, Professor Struik made some corrections and added an appendix with a sketch of the application of Cartan's method of Pfaffians to curve and surface theory. The result was to further increase the merit of this stimulating, thought-provoking text &#x2014; ideal for classroom use, but also perfectly suited for self-study. In this attractive, inexpensive paperback edition, it belongs in the library of any mathematician or student of mathematics interested in differential geometry.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Cannibal Island: Death in a Siberian Gulag (Human Rights and Crimes against Humanity, 2)</h2><p><p>During the spring of 1933, Stalin's police rounded up nearly one hundred thousand people as part of the Soviet regime's "cleansing" of Moscow and Leningrad and deported them to Siberia. Many of the victims were sent to labor camps, but ten thousand of them were dumped in a remote wasteland and left to fend for themselves. <i>Cannibal Island</i> reveals the shocking, grisly truth about their fate.</p><p>These people were abandoned on the island of Nazino without food or shelter. Left there to starve and to die, they eventually began to eat each other. Nicolas Werth, a French historian of the Soviet era, reconstructs their gruesome final days using rare archival material from deep inside the Stalinist vaults. Werth skillfully weaves this episode into a broader story about the Soviet frenzy in the 1930s to purge society of all those deemed to be unfit. For Stalin, these undesirables included criminals, opponents of forced collectivization, vagabonds, gypsies, even entire groups in Soviet society such as the "kulaks" and their families. Werth sets his story within the broader social and political context of the period, giving us for the first time a full picture of how Stalin's system of "special villages" worked, how hundreds of thousands of Soviet citizens were moved about the country in wholesale mass transportations, and how this savage bureaucratic machinery functioned on the local, regional, and state levels.</p><p><i>Cannibal Island</i> challenges us to confront unpleasant facts not only about Stalin's punitive social controls and his failed Soviet utopia, but about every generation's capacity for brutality--including our own.</p></p><p><p>"Perhaps it is not surprising that Nicolas Werth, the French historian who cowrote <i>The Black Book of Communism</i>, has decided in <i>Cannibal Island</i> to return to an incident he merely mentioned in that vast book. He was right to do so: in its way, this small, brilliant work, the description of a single incident, is every bit as powerful a condemnation of Communist ideology as the Black Book itself."<b>--Anne Applebaum, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <i>Gulag: A History</i></b></p><p>"In this gripping new work, Nicolas Werth documents the horrifying story of the forced deportation of 'socially-dangerous elements' from Moscow and Leningrad to the forbidding island of Nazino. With the use of dramatic new documents from previously classified Soviet archives, he chronicles for the first time in English the atrocities that unfolded on 'cannibal island.' This is an absorbing, indeed chilling tale of savagery, highlighting in microcosm the brutal realities of Stalinist socialism in action."<b>--Lynne Viola, author of <i>The Unknown Gulag: The Lost World of Stalin's Special Settlements</i></b></p><p>"Werth has as solid a command of the Soviet-era archival documentation as anyone. But while he lays out a synthetic, institutional panorama of a segment of Soviet bureaucracy, he can write at the same time a story full of suspense, in a crisp and lucid style. He certainly does both with shattering effect in his <i>Cannibal Island</i>."<b>--Jan T.

Richly textured chapters-all written especially for this volume-explain key concepts of RCT and demonstrate their application with diverse individuals, couples, families, and groups, as well as in institutional settings. Emphasizing that relationship is the work of therapy, case narratives illuminate both the therapist and client factors that promote or interfere with movement toward connection. Highlighted are the ways in which cultural contexts profoundly influence relationships; how growthful connection inevitably includes conflict; and how experienced therapists work on a moment-by-moment basis to engage with and counteract personal and cultural forces of disconnection.<br></p><p>Maureen Walker, PhD, a licensed psychologist, is the director of program development at the JBMTI and the associate director of MBA Support Services at Harvard Business School. She is a coeditor of <i>The Complexity of Connection</i>. <br><br>Wendy B. Rosen, PhD, a licensed clinical social worker, is on the faculty of the JBMTI and on the attending staff of McLean Hospital. She is also an adjunct faculty member at Smith College School for Social Work. <br>"<i>How Connections Heal</i> is an exemplary contribution to the all-too-scant literature that discusses clinical process from the viewpoint of both clients and therapists. The eleven case studies address a range of clinical modalities, including individual, couple, and group therapy, while also considering treatment approaches with women in prison, delinquent girls, and substance abusers. The authors&#x2019; interest in and ability to utilize an understanding of cultural variables is intrinsic to the treatment model, and is of particular value to mental health practitioners treating diverse clients. This book will be read and reread, both by graduate students in the various mental health fields and by experienced therapists who wish to advance their understanding of how treatment actually works. Regardless of the reader&#x2019;s theoretical orientation, the book makes an impressive and eloquent argument for the value of studying case material in fine detail."--Gerald Schamess, MSS, Professor Emeritus, Smith College School for Social Work<br><br>"A major contribution to the psychotherapy literature. Superbly organized and written chapters present a rich and wide array of cases, providing articulate, powerful illustrations of how relational-cultural theory can be applied in practice. Up-close views of work with diverse clients include fascinating discussions of therapist self-reflection and the repair of therapeutic errors. Much more of a 'page turner' than one can usually hope for in a professional book, <i>How Connections Heal </i>presents therapeutic dilemmas with which readers will readily identify and shows how other therapists have resolved them, interweaving cultural and feminist perspectives throughout. This is a highly interesting and informative resource for new as well as seasoned psychotherapists."--Melba J. T. Vasquez, PhD, ABPP, private practice, Austin, Texas; past president, American Psychological Association Society for the Psychology of Women (Division 35) and Society of Counseling Psychology (Division 17)<br><br>"<i>How Connections Heal </i>delivers the crucial message that therapists can help or harm because of who we are and what we bring to our work, rather than because of an impersonal set of techniques we use with every client. If relational-cultural theory (RCT) is the 'why,' this book addresses the 'how,' presenting first-person accounts of the use of RCT in an impressively broad range of arenas, from individual psychotherapy to groups of women in prisons.

Ranging from Frederick Douglass to rap artist Ice Cube, Michael C. Dawson brilliantly illuminates the history and current role of black political thought in shaping political debate in America.</p><p>In <i>Black Visions</i>, Michael Dawson brings us the most comprehensive analysis to date of the complex relationship of black political thought to black political identity and behavior. Combining a historical perspective with conceptual sophistication and empirical evidence, Dawson identifies which political ideologies are supported by blacks, then traces their historical roots and examines their effects on black public opinion, not only among intellectuals and activists, but also at the grassroots level.<br><br>Although many (mostly white) commentators have argued that black political thought falls within the realm of American liberalism, many black commentators regard black political thought as a rejection of this liberalism. Here, Dawson argues that black visions are more varied and complex. Black ideologies, such as radical egalitarianism, disillusioned liberalism, and black conservatism do criticize American liberalism while still accepting its basic tenets. But other ideologies-black nationalism, black feminism, and black Marxism&#x2014;challenge one or more of the premises of American liberalism. Ultimately, Dawson provocatively argues that the rise of a black counterpublic in the nineteenth century made the development of distinctive currents of black political thought possible. Based on the most extensive study of black public opinion to date, Dawson shows how each ideology still affects blacks' views on such issues as their position in American society, the nature of whites, and separatism.<br><br>Ranging from Frederick Douglass to rap artist Ice Cube, Dawson brilliantly illuminates the history and current role of black political thought in shaping political debate in America.<b>Michael C.

This alternative practice is one of the exciting frontiers of therapy and will enrich the work of therapists, medical practitioners, and bodyworkers.Body and mind are functionally inseparable. The cultural separation of body and mind, however, has confused our thinking and created obstacles for psychological health. This separation is itself firmly planted in the practices of standard psychotherapy. In the first part of the book, Aposhyan discusses this false division and goes on to articulate the theoretical basis for the unity of body and mind. Drawing on research in neuroscience and developmental conceptions of human attachment, bodily processes including nonverbal attunement, processing, and regulation are shown to be basic to what transpires in therapy. This account culminates in a chapter on the links between biology and consciousness that are critical for therapeutic that addresses the whole person.Part 2 provides an overview of the basic form of BMP. Beginning with the tasks of therapy, the chapters in this part describe the format of therapy in terms of a cycle of interaction between body and mind concluding with a consideration of the primary goal of BMP--i.e., a synchronization of body and mind founded in body awareness. The therapy professional is also offered methods to cultivate his or her own embodiment. For the psychotherapist, personal embodiment is the single most important key to integrating the body into psychotherapy practice.The body systems are reviewed in Part 3. Aposhyan takes the reader on a detailed tour of various important systems including the muscular, skeletal, and nervous systems as well as the skin, fluids, viscera, and endocrine systems. The result is an articulate picture of an integrated set of body functions all of which have their distinct roles and yet communicate with and have a bearing upon the functioning of each other. The specific techniques of BMP are grounded in this detailed picture of the various body systems. In Part 4 Aposhyan instructs readers in how to anchor in the body the change affected by BMP. Discussions here consider change at the cellular level and address specific clinical issues critical to BMP. <em>Body-Mind Psychotherapy</em> offers a simple, user-friendly, and safe approach to integrating the body into therapy and psychological exploration. The techniques involved are consistent with research from neuroscience, psychological development, and traumatology. As a result, the reader will find BMP both an effective and research-based therapeutic approach.</p><p>Susan Aposhyan, M.A., developed Body-Mind Psychotherapy and has been involved in training psychotherapists internationally in this method for two decades. She maintains a private practice and has also authored Natural Intelligence: Body-Mind Integration and Human Development.<p>Body-Mind Psychotherapy is a body psychotherapy classic, equivalent to Reich's Character Structure or Lowen's Language of the Body. But it's more than that, it's actually a contribution to the field of contemporary psychotherapy as a whole. . . . [S]parkles with insight, humour, and gentleness.

"</p></p><h2>Ways of War and Peace: Realism, Liberalism, and Socialism</h2><p><p><strong>In the wake of the Cold War, as the international community struggles to accommodate change, the author of this study directs our attention to the classic theorists, Thucydides, Rousseau, Locke and others.</strong></p> He explores their enduring theories, and recommends that they be applied to today's fundamental international dilemmas. Although no one school has all the answers, this analysis maintains that history has provided the theoretical tools to meet modern challenges, and that great political minds of the past can still guide modern politicians through the confusion of current events.</p><p>A majestic survey of the West's principal schools of sociopolitical thought. In making an (at least tacit) appeal for theoretic pluralism, Princeton political scientist Doyle focuses on three intellectual traditions: realism, liberalism, and socialism. While doing so, he provides perceptive perspectives on the worldviews of important thinkers down through the ages. To probe the canons of realism, for example, the author assesses Thucydides and a trio of latter-day counterparts (Hobbes, Machiavelli, Rousseau). Likewise, he draws on Bentham, Kant, Locke, Schumpeter, and Smith (as in Adam) to illustrate the breadth and depth of international liberalism. Last but not least, Doyle examines socialism through the minds of Lenin and Marx. He reviews the way in which each theory enjoys a comparative advantage in explaining historic events and foreign policies, e.g., the tendency of liberal states to engage in aggression against less enlightened or more authoritarian regimes. The author goes on to appraise what direction the three constructs might offer on some of the world's knottier problems, inter alia, the issue of interventions in the name of human rights as well as other putatively just causes, and whether economic aid to less developed countries is an investment in security for industrial powers or an effort to promote democratic institutions while alleviating poverty. Doyle also considers the future of geopolitics, concluding that even post-millennial humanity will have a divided soul that owes allegiance to the competing claims of many constituencies, of which government is but one. Even so, he argues, the past teaches that enemies can be contained, peace extended, and (if need be) revolutions launched. A world-class yet accessible discourse on the abiding power of political ideas that could furnish reliable guidance to the electorates and leaders of almost any nation on earth. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>If you want your political theory served up in big slabs of detail, analysis, and interpretation, then Doyle's latest work is for you. Doyle, who teaches politics and international affairs at Princeton, has published a number of significant books (e.g., UN Peacekeeping in Cambodia, Lynne Rienner, 1995). His latest is not easy reading?in fact, it's one of the densest books this reviewer has encountered in a while?but that is not completely Doyle's fault. He is grappling with presenting a sophisticated explication of complex thought on how states organize and manage themselves within the international community. Doyle divides his philosophies into three camps?Realism, Liberalism, and Socialism?and then proceeds to contrast and compare the writings of the major proponents of each. Thus, the reader is exposed in turn to Thucydides, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Rousseau, Locke, Bentham, Kant, Marx, and Lenin, to name only the most significant figures who fall under Doyle's penetrating gaze. Despite the challenges this book will present to uninformed readers, it is an important study that belongs in any collection supporting research in political theory or international relations.?Edward Goedeken, Iowa State Univ.

Second, each chapter includes a list of &#x2018;top picks&#x2019;&#x2014;published scholarly works that exemplify good criticism using the approach featured in the chapter&#x2014;annotated to position the recommended reading in a larger conversation and to reveal important aspects of it. Finally, the glossary presents a quick reference guide that students will appreciate. (Samantha Senda-Cook, Creighton University)<br><br>Kuypers has assembled an all-star cast of rhetoricians to explore critical lenses in which they are most expert and, in some cases, of which they are the actual generative voice. The contributors provide students with theoretical underpinnings of differing 'schools' of criticism, steps to follow when writing within a particular critical perspective, examples of criticism specific to the critical lens, and some professional and personal perspectives on the use of the method under investigation. No other text combines the theoretical with the applied and personal in such a way. Kuypers's volume makes criticism come alive as a public craft and as a personal endeavor. (Jason Black, University of Alabama)<br><br>Professor Kuypers has assembled an excellent chorus of voices to introduce the art and criticism of public persuasion.

Four hundred years later, Baptists are the second-largest religious group in America, and their influence matches their numbers. They have built strong institutions, from megachurches to publishing houses to charities to mission organizations, and have firmly established themselves in the mainstream of American culture. Yet the historical legacy of outsider status lingers, and the inherently fractured nature of their faith makes Baptists ever wary of threats from within as well as without.<br><br>In <em>Baptists in America</em>, Thomas S. Kidd and Barry Hankins explore the long-running tensions between church, state, and culture that Baptists have shaped and navigated. Despite the moment of unity that their early persecution provided, their history has been marked by internal battles and schisms that were microcosms of national events, from the conflict over slavery that divided North from South to the conservative revolution of the 1970s and 80s. Baptists have made an indelible impact on American religious and cultural history, from their early insistence that America should have no established church to their place in the modern-day culture wars, where they frequently advocate greater religious involvement in politics. Yet the more mainstream they have become, the more they have been pressured to conform to the mainstream, a paradox that defines--and is essential to understanding--the Baptist experience in America.<br><br>Kidd and Hankins, both practicing Baptists, weave the threads of Baptist history alongside those of American history. <em>Baptists in America</em> is a remarkable story of how one religious denomination was transformed from persecuted minority into a leading actor on the national stage, with profound implications for American society and culture.<br></p><p><br><strong>Thomas S.

Roberta Greene covers theoretical areas and individual theorists including classical psychoanalytic thought, Eriksonian theory, Carl Rogers, cognitive theory, systems theory, ecological perspectives, social construction, feminism, and genetics. She discusses the historical context, its philosophical roots, and major assumptions of each theory. The general theme, which distinguishes this volume, is that the person-in-environment perspective has been a central influence in the formation of the profession's knowledge base, as well as its approach to practice. Greene provides perspective on how individuals and social systems interact.</p> <p>This book examines how social workers can use theory to shape social work practice by increasing his or her understanding of and potential for enhancing human well-being. Greene covers the relationship between human behavior theory and professional social work practice. She also explores the challenges and limitations of each theory and addresses the following issues: how the theory serves as a framework for social work practice; how the theory lends itself to an understanding of individual, family, group, community, or organizational behavior; what the implications are of the theory for social work interventions or practice strategies; and what role it proposes for the social worker as a change agent.</p> <p>Throughout the profession's history, social workers have turned to a number of theoretical approaches for the organizing concepts needed to define their practice base. The aims of social work--to improve societal conditions and to enhance social functioning of and between individuals, families, and groups--are put into action across all fields of practice and realized through a variety of methods in a range of settings. This third edition, completely revised, represents a fundamental contribution to the field, and like its predecessors, will be widely used as a basic text.</p></p><p><p><em>Roberta R.&nbsp;Greene </em>was the Louis and Ann Wolens Centennial Chair in Gerontology and Social Welfare at the School of Social Work, University of Texas-Austin.&nbsp;</p><p> &#x201c;Another in a growing collection of books by social workers designed to summarize and clarify a variety of conceptual paradigms that purport to explain human behavior in its social context.

The purpose of the Self Awareness Practice is to live in the eternal bliss that is your true Self. This book has all new Palatino 15 type for crisp clear easy reading. The quotes in Chapter One are the same as the quotes in Chapter (Step) Seven from the book The Seven Steps to Awakening. Chapters Two and Three are essentially the same as Chapters Seven and Eight from the book The Most Direct Means to Eternal Bliss. Self Awareness Practice Instructions is Book One in a series of six books called the Self Realization Series. One purpose of the Self Realization Series is to put just one category of quotes into a small book that has the advantage of making it easier to focus, meditate on, grasp, and have insight into just one subject at a time. That makes the approach simple, easier and less complicated. The idea is to stay focused on just one subject until you have received everything you need to receive from that one subject. Most people go on to the next subject without ever having learned to apply to their lives the subject they are studying now. The Self Realization series of books are practice manuals aimed at helping sincere seekers of Self Realization master one Key to Self Realization at a time. The six books in the Self Realization Series are: 1. Self Awareness Practice Instructions. 2. The Desire for Liberation. 3. The False self. 4. Inspiration and Encouragement on the Path to Self Realization. 5. Everything is an Illusion. 6.

Off the field, he&#x2019;s unabashedly the cruise director of the NFL.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>New York Post</i><br> <br> Rob &#x201c;Gronk&#x201d; Gronkowski holds nine league-wide records and three Patriots franchise records. His accomplishments include thirty-eight receiving touchdowns in his first three seasons (thirteen more than any other tight end in the NFL) and the 2011 record for most touchdowns made by a tight end, with seventeen receiving and eighteen overall. With a Super Bowl victory under his belt and a nationwide reputation for a personality that&#x2019;s &#x201c;comedy gold&#x201d; (CBS Sports), he has continued to win the hearts of fans through his fun-loving attitude.<br> <br> From hamming it up at Super Bowl Media Day, to spicing up interviews with &#x201c;Gronk-esque&#x201d; dance moves, to cuddling with kittens in the pages of <i>ESPN The Magazine</i>, to christening a used party bus his ride of choice, Gronk&#x2019;s good humor and playful persona make it seem like other players are &#x201c;living in black and white, and Gronk is in color&#x201d; (CBS Sports). But it&#x2019;s not all fun and games. After multiple surgeries on his forearms, ankle, and back, Gronk tore his ACL and MCL, prematurely ending his 2013 season (but not before scoring four touchdowns and 592 receiving yards). His many injuries and subsequent recoveries made his key play in Super Bowl XLIX&#x2014;which led to victory and the title of &#x201c;Comeback Player of the Year&#x201d;&#x2014;all the sweeter. Gronk takes fans from the field to the locker room to the VIP room to the talk show green room to his parents&#x2019; kitchen table&#x2014;a full tour of the world according to Gronk.</p><p>Rob &#x201c;Gronk&#x201d; Gronkowski played college football for the University of Arizona before beginning his legendary career as a tight end for the New England Patriots. Hailed as one of the best tight ends the NFL has ever seen, Gronk is going into his sixth season with 54 touchdowns, over 4,300 receiving yards, nine NFL-wide records, three Patriots franchise records, and millions of fans who can&#x2019;t get enough Gronk.<br><br>Jason Rosenhaus is a sports agent, lawyer, certified public accountant, and writer. He is the coauthor, with Drew Rosenhaus and Don Yaeger, of <i>A Shark Never Sleeps.</i>It&#x2019;s Good to Be Gronk 1<p></p> MEET THE GRONKS<p></p> <br>From day one, all I ever wanted to do was have fun with my brothers. Whether that fun came from playing sports, joking around, dancing crazy, wrestling, or just being me, that was what made me happy. And now, twenty-something years later I refuse to let success, money, fame, beautiful women, or anyone or anything else change me. Why should I change? I&#x2019;m a happy guy, I don&#x2019;t hurt anyone (except when I&#x2019;m paid to do it on the football field), I work superhard, I don&#x2019;t break the law, and I&#x2019;m all about working hard, playing hard, and being a good guy to the kids. What&#x2019;s wrong with that? Absolutely nothing, so I&#x2019;m going to play ball, work out in the gym, hit my playbook, run on the track, party with my family, and do all of it Gronk-style!<br> <br>That doesn&#x2019;t mean I&#x2019;m going do things my way or not at all. That means I&#x2019;m gonna do things the right way, the best way I can or not at all. That&#x2019;s how I was raised and that&#x2019;s who I am. There was no other way for me to be. I grew up in a house in Buffalo, New York, with four brothers. In that house, we had constant fun and action. Our idea of fun was beating the hell out of each other and laughing the whole time as we got our shots in. I had three older brothers and one younger brother and we did nothing but all-out brawl all day, every day. My poor mom, Diane, had no chance of handling all of us and my dad, Gordy, set two rules we all had to follow&#x2014;no punching to the face, or to the balls. Anything other than that, and I mean anything, was fair game.<br> <br>One afternoon my dad came home from work and walked into the kitchen to see what the ruckus was. My older brother Chris, who was fifteen at the time, had me, thirteen, pinned on my back. The loud thumping my dad heard was Chris grabbing fistfuls of my hair with both hands and smacking the top of my head back and forth into the linoleum kitchen floor. My dad, who is a big man himself, and had played college football, picked us both up with each arm and held us against the wall. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s it! We&#x2019;re gonna settle this right now.&#x201d;<br> <br>My dad was our idol; he was big, strong, tough, and smart. We all respected him and his two rules mostly because he was the only thing in the world we were afraid of. He was mean when he had to be, but always fair. After separating us, my dad brought us into the living room and cleared out the couch and other furniture so the center of the room was empty. He gave us both one of the big pillows on the couch and let us smash into each other full speed until we tired ourselves out. He called it zoom-zoom. From then on, whenever he had to break up a fight between us, we resolved it through zoom-zoom, where we banged into each other, over and over again like only kids can do, until we were both exhausted. We loved it!<br> <br>Another time, when I was eight and Chris was ten, I caught him taking one of my Reese&#x2019;s Pieces packets from my Halloween candy bag. Back then, Halloween candy was like gold to us. We would spend the night running from house to house with huge pillowcases to grab and carry as much candy as we could. Whoever had the biggest bag with the most candy had the best night among all of us. It was a major competition in our household.<br> <br>That year, I was particularly proud of my large bag of candy and guarded it like it was pirate treasure. When Chris took a Reese&#x2019;s Pieces packet from my bag, I went nuts. I grabbed one of my mini hockey sticks (it&#x2019;s about a foot long) and ran toward him and checked him as hard as I could. Before Chris could get up, I started whacking him with the stick. Chris fought his way up and ran after me. Chris was a lot bigger and more muscular than I was since he was stocky and older. Since I was smaller than my older brothers, my technique was to hit them with the best shot I could and then run off and try to escape.<br> <br>After knocking Chris down, I sprinted toward the bathroom and tried to close the door behind me, but Chris was coming full speed. He put his shoulder into it and barreled through the door. I was caught off balance and the force of the door sent me flying backward. I hit the back of my head on the front of the hard bathtub and was knocked out cold.<br> <br>When Chris saw I wasn&#x2019;t moving, he thought I was dead and he ran off into the living room in a panic, calling for our parents. While Chris was panicking in the living room, I woke up, grabbed my stick, and went right back at him. By the time my dad came downstairs, Chris got checked from behind and was knocked to the floor.<br> <br>To understand us, you have to picture five boys growing up together in the same household in upstate New York. The oldest, Gord (not to be confused with our dad, Gordy), is the most outgoing, fun-loving, and partying guy of the group. Gord went on to play professional baseball and was a tall first baseman. Gord was six years older than me. Next came Danny, who was the biggest and best athlete around but was always responsible and mature for his age. Dan was four years older than me. Then came Chris, who was an intimidating, mean, and scary kid. Chris enjoyed inflicting pain on everyone who would bother him. Chris was two years older than me and I fought him the most. Then came Glenn, who we all call Goose. Goose is four years younger than me and he took a beating the same as everyone else.<br> <br>To me, fighting my brothers was fun. The problem was that I was smaller than Gord, Dan, and Chris. These were really big guys who would all become professional athletes. Since I was younger and smaller, the only way to even the odds was to hit them with whatever I could find and then run like hell to escape. Most of the time I got away but when I didn&#x2019;t, I took my beating like a man.<br> <br>One afternoon, my dad&#x2019;s brother, my uncle Glen, came over to visit us. I loved Uncle Glen. He was a fun uncle to talk with so I was pissed off when I saw Dan talking to him where I had been sitting five minutes earlier. I had just gone into the kitchen for a minute to get something to eat and when I came back Dan had taken my seat. When I saw Dan laughing it up with Uncle Glen, I was determined to get him. I didn&#x2019;t care that Dan had no idea he pissed me off and that it was unintentional. Once I had any reason to attack, any reason whatsoever, I was gonna take my best shot. So I snuck out of the kitchen behind Dan and with a full sprint toward the living room, tackled Dan all-out. I rammed my elbow right into the back of his ribs and got him good.<br> <br>Dan had no clue what had happened but he knew the drill. He knew I didn&#x2019;t need much of a reason and got up instantly to chase me down. Dan was four years older than me and bigger, faster, and stronger than I was. To make things worse, Chris was there and saw what I did, so for the fun of it and because I deserved it, Chris helped Dan catch me, grab me, and hold me down. From there, Dan just pounded me in my thighs, punching me over and over again, giving me a brutal charley horse. That was their deal. Dan and Chris knew my dad would knock the hell out of them if they punched me in the face or balls, so they stayed within the rules and did their worst!<br> <br>Whenever they could catch me, and that was most of the time, Chris would hold me down and Dan would savagely, without mercy, whale on me with his fists, elbows, and knees. The thing is, I always deserved it because I had always started it. And I always started it because after a while, my thighs, shoulders, arms, and stomach all toughened up and the blows didn&#x2019;t hurt anymore. So when I got caught and no matter how hard they punched, elbowed, and kneed me, I could take it and started laughing uncontrollably. It was so much fun to me to tackle them when they weren&#x2019;t looking and I liked it when they beat the hell out of me. There was just nothing they could do to stop me, so it was a nonstop cycle of brawling.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know why I always started the trouble. Dan didn&#x2019;t deserve for me to tackle him and elbow him in the back of his ribs. He never bullied me or picked on me. But when I started it, he would do his best to finish it and make me pay for it.<br> <br>Dan was a really good kid. He was the all-American guy you would want to marry your daughter. He was the biggest and best athlete wherever he went, did really well in school, and as I said, was very mature for his age. Chris, on the other hand, was not a really good kid. While wicked smart with his grades, Chris got my father&#x2019;s mean streak and took it to the next level. Chris enjoyed beating me up and dishing out pain. Whenever Dan gave me a charley horse it was only because I really pushed his buttons. I didn&#x2019;t need to push Chris&#x2019;s buttons; he was always ready to throw punches, elbows, and knees. He loved beating me up and I loved trying to get him back. I wasn&#x2019;t afraid. For whatever reason, I loved causing trouble and pissing people off, it was fun. Because Chris was closest to me in age, I always wanted to do what he was doing and whenever I couldn&#x2019;t, I would tackle him, elbow, knee him&#x2014;whatever shots I could get in, I took. And when Chris wasn&#x2019;t around, I would fight Dan even though he was twice my size and four years older.<br> <br>Because they were bigger than me I had to use whatever I could get my hands on to help even the odds. My favorite weapon of choice was the Gronk family trumpet. At our elementary school, everyone had to play the trumpet in the fifth grade. It started with Gord, was passed down to Dan, then to Chris, then to me, and then to Goose. When Gord had it, it was shiny and in perfect condition. By the time I got it, that thing looked like it had been run over by a car. It had dents and scratches on it everywhere. I don&#x2019;t know how the thing still worked when Goose got it.<br> <br>The dents and scratches are from when I used to come after Dan with it. I couldn&#x2019;t help but be angry when Dan would tease me about anything. If we just played a game downstairs in the basement or in the backyard and I lost, any type of bragging on their part or criticism of my game would set me off. If I won, I would start teasing them over and over again until they couldn&#x2019;t take it anymore, and things would escalate pretty quickly and get out of hand, Ron Burgundy&#x2013;style.<br> <br>I remember Dan was babysitting at home one night and he had had enough of my smart-aleck remarks and told me to go upstairs to my room. He warned me not to come back downstairs. I was angry so I went right upstairs, into his room, grabbed the trumpet out of the case, and came downstairs yelling at him, holding it over my head. For once I was doing the chasing and Dan was doing the running. I couldn&#x2019;t catch him so I threw it at him and missed, which I probably did intentionally. He was super-mad and I knew he would beat the hell out of me, but I didn&#x2019;t care. I wasn&#x2019;t afraid. Over the years, I came at him a lot with that trumpet but I never really got him full-contact with it.<br> <br>The trumpet wasn&#x2019;t the only thing I threw. One time I threw a fork at Dan. I can&#x2019;t even remember why, but I missed him anyway. The problem was I hit the babysitter with it and it stuck into her hand. The poor lady had had no idea what she signed up for when she had to pull the fork out of her hand. She obviously didn&#x2019;t come back.<br> <br>No matter what I threw at Sweet Pete, he always came back. Sweet Pete was Dan&#x2019;s best friend in high school. Dan played quarterback and his left tackle was Pete DeAngelo. He lived down the block and was always over. Back then, &#x201c;sweet&#x201d; meant cool, so it was a compliment, and Pete had a big head as one of the cool kids. When Sweet Pete would come over, we would play some type of mini-hockey-stick game downstairs in the basement. More important than winning and scoring goals was seeing who could check who the hardest into the concrete foundation wall.<br> <br>Now, Sweet Pete was 6�1&#x2dd; and 215, which was pretty big for high school. Since I was four years younger than Sweet Pete, he was still stronger and bigger than I was, but I didn&#x2019;t care.<br> <br>Whatever game they were playing, I wanted to play. Whatever they were doing, I wanted to do. And no matter what, by the end of the day, Pete and I would always go at it. He loved beating me up. If I didn&#x2019;t start with him, he would start with me. Whenever he and I were in the house together, there was going to be a battle.<br> <br>I would tease Pete all the time and tell him he wasn&#x2019;t sweet (meaning he was not cool). I would say that and whatever else aggravated him over and over again until he and Dan couldn&#x2019;t take it anymore and they came after me. They would tackle me, hold me down, and charley-horse my thighs and shoulders, but I didn&#x2019;t feel any pain. I couldn&#x2019;t help but laugh uncontrollably the whole time. They beat the hell out of me but I loved it.<br> <br>There aren&#x2019;t too many people who can walk around and say they beat the hell out of Rob Gronkowski all the time, but Sweet Pete can. But now the tables have obviously turned and things have changed. Sweet Pete still likes to brag to everyone that he toughened me up and made me the man I am today, etc.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And it finally caught up to him at Dan&#x2019;s bachelor party in Las Vegas in the summer of 2011.<br> <br>That crazy weekend, we went to Vegas for Dan&#x2019;s bachelor party and stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel. Dan had this monster suite where me, Gord, Dan, Chris, Goose, and Sweet Pete were staying. The suite had a huge couch on it. After we had one drink too many, Sweet Pete, who is now in shape at 6�1&#x2dd; and 250 pounds, started talking trash that he could still take me. He played center on the Ithaca College football team in New York and said he could knock me on my butt.<br> <br>He was loud and animated, talking trash to me. He actually climbed up on the couch and got into a three-point stance and challenged me to do the same opposite him and see who could knock who off the couch.<br> <br>Now, I hadn&#x2019;t wrestled with Pete since I was in the eighth grade, so it had been over ten years since we last matched up, but I had been waiting a long time to get even with him. He must have checked me like a thousand times into that concrete wall as hard as he could and celebrated each time like he had just won the Stanley Cup. So in Vegas I couldn&#x2019;t resist and jumped at the chance.<br> <br>Next thing I know, Sweet Pete dove low and went all-out, knocking me off balance, and I fell off the couch. He jumped up and cheered once again like he did in the old days. I didn&#x2019;t like losing at all so I immediately said, &#x201c;Two out of three, let&#x2019;s go!&#x201d;<br> <br>He was still talking smack but as he lined up, I looked right into him and he knew I was going to bring it. To his credit, he didn&#x2019;t back down and came after me. This time I took him seriously and got the jump on him. I exploded into him and knocked him straight back and up in the air. He somehow flipped over and landed on his face. He didn&#x2019;t move for a second and then he picked his face up and the side of it was red. Sweet Pete got a big black eye and spent the whole weekend walking around with it. The thing took forever to heal and he brought it back to work with him for a week. I&#x2019;m not going to lie, I don&#x2019;t feel bad about it at all. I love it! A little payback.<br> <br>I guess some things don&#x2019;t change. I&#x2019;m still the same as I was when I was kid. I remember one time we went on a family vacation to visit our uncle, who thought it would be a good idea to take Chris and me out on his sailboat. About twenty minutes into the journey I whacked Chris over the head with the big scoop fishnet on the boat. I obviously ruined the net but the boat managed to stay afloat until our uncle could get the boat turned around and safely back to shore.

Many think of heaven as an unimaginable state of bliss. As for hell, it's far out of proportion to any sin we might have committed and makes a travesty of God. But what if the afterlife was something very different? &nbsp;Three decades of research have taught the author, a world expert in the field of death and afterlife studies,&nbsp;where the&nbsp;most reliable&nbsp;sources are to be found. These accounts are far better developed and more plausible than anything found in the world's scriptures or theologies. We hunger for a reliable revelation telling us that life here and now is meaningful and good, that each of us has an important part to play in its proper unfolding, that we are accountable for all we do, and that the&nbsp;spirit-denying materialism all around us is a&nbsp;mistake. The world ahead, unlike ours, is fascinating and fair. Authentic&nbsp;channels through which the "dead" speak&nbsp;are the closest thing to the voice of God that our planet has.</p><p>Stafford Betty&nbsp;has a&nbsp;PhD in theology from Fordham University, teaches religious studies at California State University in Bakersfield, and has gradually evolved into a world expert on afterlife studies. Originally a specialist in Asian religious thought and the philosophy of religion--with many publications to his name, some&nbsp;in top-tier journals--he branched out into paranormal research when he found that the big questions about&nbsp;the meaning of life were unanswered in the safe, tidy world of academic orthodoxy. "Paranormal studies is the next frontier for philosophers and scientists to venture into," Betty says.&nbsp; "It is a tragedy that an area of studies so filled with hope for all of us is commonly snubbed by leading intellectuals and trend setters,&nbsp;who refuse to even look at the evidence." Betty is also a novelist.&nbsp; His latest novel, <i>The Imprisoned Splendor,</i>&nbsp;is set in the afterlife.&nbsp;There can be few, if any, more important questions than what happens to us when we die. This book contains what purport to be reports from people who have died, telling us in what conditions they live, and how they may move on from one sphere to another. Whatever they may make of this, everyone will find it intensely interesting. <br>&#x2014; <b>John Hick</b>, Author of <i>Death and Eternal Life</i>, preeminent philosopher of global religion<br><br> After conducting a pattern and content analysis of details that spirit sources described about their afterlife world through credible mediums, Dr. Betty spells out 44 specific details of the afterlife, most of which differ from the views of major world religions. Belief in these revelations that the nature of our afterlife existence depends upon using our free will to evolve spiritually in love and wisdom in this life is the core message of this book.<br>&#x2014; <b>Boyce Batey</b>, Executive Director of Academy of Spirituality and Paranormal Studies</p><h2>Blueschild Baby: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>A searing chronicle of the life of a young ex-convict and heroin addict in 1960&#x2019;s Harlem, an unsparing portrait of a man who couldn&#x2019;t free himself from the horrors of addiction &nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Blueschild Baby</em> takes place during the summer of 1967&#x2014;the summer of race riots all across the nation; the Summer of Love in the Haight Ashbury; the summer of Marines dying near Con Thien, across the world in Vietnam&#x2014;but the novel illuminates the contours of a more private hell: the angry desperation of a heroin addict who returns to his home in Harlem after being in prison. </p><p>First published in 1970, this frankly autobiographical novel was a revelation, a stunning depiction of a marginal figure, marked literally and figuratively by his drug addiction and navigating a predatory underground of junkies and hustlers&#x2014;and named George Cain, like his author. </p><p>Now with a new preface by acclaimed writer Leslie Jamison, this is an unvarnished conjuring of the tyranny of dependence: its desperation, its degradation, its rage and rebellion; the fragile, unsettled, occasional shards of hope it permits; the strange joys of being alive and young and lost and hooked and full of feverish determination anyway.</p></p><p><p><strong>George Cain</strong> was born in New York in 1943.

Deep down, she still feels like a lonely, gawky teenager.

Here is their story as re-imagined by Thomas Pynchon, in an updated eighteenth-century novel featuring Native Americans and frontier folk, ripped bodices, naval warfare, conspiracies erotic and political, major caffeine abuse. We follow the mismatch&#39;d pair - one rollicking, the other depressive; one Gothic, the other pre-Romantic - from their first journey together to the Cape of Good Hope, to pre-Revoluntionary America and back, through the strange yet redemptive turns of fortune in their later lives, on a grand tour of the Enlightenment&#39;s dark hemisphere, as they observe and participate in the many opportunities for insanity presented them by the Age of Reason.</p><p>A sprawling, complex, and comic work from one of the country's most celebrated and idiosyncratic authors, <i>Mason &amp; Dixon</i> is Thomas Pynchon's Most Magickal reinvention of the 18th-century novel. It follows the lifelong partnership and adventures of the English surveyors Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon (of Mason-Dixon Line fame) as they travel the world mapping and measuring through an uncharted pre-Revolutionary America of Native Americans, white settlers, taverns, and bawdy establishments of ill-repute. Fans of the postmodern master of paranoia will recognize Pynchon's personality in the novel's first phrase: "Snow-Balls have flown their Arcs," a brief echo of the rockets that curve across the skies in the writer's masterpiece Gravity's Rainbow.Thomas Pynchon is the author of V., The Crying of Lot 49, Gravity&#39;s Rainbow, Slow Learner, a collection of short stories, Vineland and, most recently, Against the Day. He received the National Book Award for Gravity&#39;s Rainbow in 1974.</p><h2>The Peoples of Sicily: A Multicultural Legacy</h2><p><p>Can the eclectic medieval history of the world's most conquered island be a lesson for our times?</p><p>Home to Normans, Byzantines, Arabs, Germans and Jews, 12th-century Sicily was a crossroads of cultures and faiths, the epitome of diversity. Here Europe, Asia and Africa met, with magical results. Bilingualism was the norm, women's rights were defended, and the environment was protected. Literacy among Sicilians soared; it was higher during this ephemeral golden age than it was seven centuries later.</p><p>But this book is about more than Sicily. It is a singular, enduring lesson in the way multicultural diversity can be encouraged, with the result being a prosperous society. While its focus is the civilizations that flourished during the island's multicultural medieval period from 1060 to 1260, most of Sicily's complex history to the end of the Middle Ages is outlined. Idrisi is mentioned, but so is Archimedes.</p><p>Introductory background chapters begin in the Neolithic, continuing to the history of the contested island under Punics and Greeks. Every civilization that populated the island is covered, including Romans, Goths, Vandals, Byzantines, Arabs, Normans, Germans, Angevins, Aragonese and Jews, with profiles of important historical figures and sites. Religion, law, geography and cuisine are also considered.</p><p>The authors' narrative is interesting but never pedantic, intended for the general reader rather than the expert in anthropology, theology, art or architecture. They are not obsessed with arcane terminology, and they don't advocate a specific agenda or world view. Here two erudite scholars take their case to the people.</p><p>Yes, this book actually sets forth the entirety of ancient and medieval Sicilian history from the earliest times until around 1500, and it presents a few nuggets of the authors' groundbreaking research in medieval manuscripts. Unlike most authors who write in English about Sicily, perhaps visiting the island for brief research trips, these two are actually based in Sicily, where their work appears on a popular website. Sicily aficionados will be familiar with their writings, which have been read by some ten million during the last five years, far eclipsing the readership of any other historians who write about Sicily. Alio and Mendola are the undisputed, international "rock stars" of Sicilian historical writing, with their own devoted fan base. Every minute of the day somebody is reading their online articles.</p><p>This is a great book for anybody who is meeting Sicily for the first time, the most significant 'general' history of the island published in fifty years and certainly one of the most eloquent. It has a detailed chronology, a useful reading list, and a brief guide suggesting places to visit. The book's structure facilitates its use as a ready reference. It would have run to around 600 pages, instead of 368 (on archival-quality, acid-free paper), were it not for the slightly smaller print of the appendices, where the chronology, the longest Sicilian timeline ever published, is 20 pages long.</p><p>Unlike most histories of Sicily, the approach to this one is multifaceted and multidisciplinary. In what may be a milestone in Sicilian historiography, a section dedicated to population genetics explains how Sicily's historic diversity is reflected in its plethora of haplogroups.</p><p>Here medieval Sicily is viewed as an example of a tolerant, multicultural society and perhaps even a model. It is an unusually inspiring message. One reader was moved to tears as she read the preface.</p><p>Can a book change our view of cultures and perhaps even the way we look at history? This one just might.</p><p>Meet the peoples!</p></p><p><p>Louis Mendola is one of Sicily&#x2019;s foremost medievalists, and one of the very few whose work is known beyond Italian borders. His first scholarly paper (on the Battle of Benevento of 1266) was published in 1985; others consider such topics as the history of the medieval Normans in Sicily. He wrote the first book covering the entire seven-century history of the Kingdom of Sicily, and the first English translations of two chronicles of the thirteenth century. Having researched in Italy, Britain, Spain, Germany, France and the Vatican, he has been consulted by The History Channel, the BBC and The New York Times. Read by millions internationally, his online articles have made him one of the most popular Sicilian historians of the present century.</p><p>Jacqueline Alio is one of Sicily&#x2019;s leading historians, and part of a new wave that is writing the history of Sicily's women. Over the last decade, she has been consulted by The History Channel, The Discovery Channel and other media. An accomplished medievalist, she has published the results of her original research while writing insightful articles for a general readership. Online, her articles have captivated millions, gaining her a special place as one of the Sicilian historians with the most readers around the world. In print, scholarly works like her translation of the Ferraris Chronicle have earned her kudos in academic circles. Margaret Queen of Sicily, the first biography of that regent, is the lengthiest published work of original scholarship written in English by a historian in Sicily. She co-authored the first book in English to outline the emerging field of Sicilian Studies. Her most recent book, the result of years of research, is a compendium of biographies of the queens of Sicily into the middle of the 13th century.</p></p><h2>The Lying Woods</h2><p>Owen Foster has never wanted for anything. Then his mother shows up at his elite New Orleans boarding school cradling a bombshell: his privileged life has been funded by stolen money. After using the family business, the single largest employer in his small Louisiana town, to embezzle millions and drain the employees' retirement accounts, Owen's father vanished without a trace, leaving Owen and his mother to deal with the fallout.<br>Owen returns to Lake Cane to finish his senior year, where people he hardly remembers despise him for his father's crimes. It's bad enough dealing with muttered insults and glares, but when Owen and his mother receive increasingly frightening threats from someone out for revenge, he knows he must get to the bottom of what really happened at Louisiana Frac...and the cryptic note his father sent him at his boarding school days before disappearing. <br>Owen's only refuge is the sprawling, isolated pecan orchard he works at after school, owned by a man named Gus who has his own secrets--and in some ways seems to know Owen better than he knows himself.

Along with a large dose of humor, it provides the father-to-be with all the know-how he needs to become a well-prepared, well-heeled partner who&#x2019;s really ready to stand upright and embrace his new responsibilities...rather than cowering from them. Every cave-student will find out how to support his mate through this emotional time, cope with his own feelings, deal with baby-related projects, and perform admirably during labor and delivery. So whether it&#x2019;s catering to his exhausted companion&#x2019;s needs by preparing a nutritional and tasty meal or engaging in a snuggle session when she craves a little cuddling, with the help of this book a guy will become the proud Cro-Magnon caregiver he longs to be!</p><p></p></p><p>This engagingly entertaining and instructive pregnancy guide is based on the conceit that most men are "twenty-first-century Cro-Magnons" at those times when an expectant father "stops, scratches his head, and mutters to his woman, 'I don't get it.' " What is immediately obvious about the book, however, is that it is actually a superb overview of the birthing experience and is a perfect companion to a classic like <i>What to Expect When You're Expecting</i>. But the Cro-Magnon conceit is what will make this a perennial gift book for expectant fathers, since even the most enlightened male might not initially be interested in learning about prenatal massages, amniocentesis and a wonderful range of easy meals to prepare for a tired spouse, all of which this book expertly details. Best of all, to serve as the reader's mentor and guide before and during childbirth, first-time authors Port and Ralston introduce a typical modern caveman named Gronk ("Role Models: John Belushi"), whose deer-in-the-headlights reactions to subjects such as sex during pregnancy are delightfully drawn by Kendall. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This excellent handbook by R. C. Bell is a basic reference to board and table games from around the world, and one of the two or three finest books ever written on the subject. Originally published in two volumes in the 1960's, it is now available for the first time in a corrected, one-volume edition.<br>Mr. Bell's encyclopedic work provides the rules and methods of play for 182 different games: Ma-jong, Hazard, Wei-ch'I (Go), backgammon, Wari, Continental draughts, Pachisi, Japanese chess, Bidou, Domino Loo, Cribbage, and many others. Volume one is divided into chapters devoted to race games, war games, games of position, Mancala games, dice games, and domino games; volume two follows the same arrangement and then proceeds to games with numbers, card games requiring boards, and games requiring manual dexterity. Additional information is furnished on making boards and pieces, and on gaming-counters.<br>Game players, toymakers, and historians of culture will welcome this guided tour of games from Egypt, Meso-America, the Orient, India, Persia, Rome, Africa, Victorian England, and many other societies. Over 300 illustrations, both photographs and line drawings, add an illuminating counterpoint to the text.</p><p></p><h2>West of Rome</h2><p><p>West of Rome's two novellas, "My Dog Stupid" and "The Orgy," fulfill the promise of their rousing titles. The latter novella opens with virtuoso description: "His name was Frank Gagliano, and he did not believe in God. He was that most singular and startling craftsman of the building trade-a left-handed bricklayer. Like my father, Frank came from Torcella Peligna, a cliff-hugging town in the Abruzzi. Lean as a spider, he wore a leather cap and puttees the year around, and he was so bowlegged a dog could lope between his knees without touching them."</p></p><p><p>John Fante began writing in 1929 and published his first short story in 1932. His first novel, <em>Wait Until Spring</em>, Bandini, was published in 1938 and was the first of his Arturo Bandini series of novels, which also include <em>The Road to Los Angeles</em> and <em>Ask the Dust</em>. A prolific screenwriter, he was stricken with diabetes in 1955. Complications from the disease brought about his blindness in 1978 and, within two years, the amputation of both legs. He continued to write by dictation to his wife, Joyce, and published <em>Dreams from Bunker Hill</em>, the final installment of the Arturo Bandini series, in 1982. He died on May 8, 1983, at the age of seventy-four.</p></p><h2>La autopista del sur y otros cuentos</h2><p>A young girl spends her summer vacation in a country house where a tiger roams...A man reading a mystery finds out too late that he is the murderer's victim...<p>In the stories collected here&#x2014;including <b>Blow-Up</b>, on which Antonioni based his film&#x2014;Julio Cortazar explores the boundary where the everyday meets the mysterious, perhaps even the terrible.

After World War I his family returned to Argentina, where he received a literature degree from the teachers college in Buenos Aires in 1935. From 1935 to 1945 he taught in secondary schools in several Argentine towns. From 1945 to 1951 he worked as a literary translator for Argentine publishing houses, translating the complete prose works of Edgar Allan Poe, as well as works by Andr� Gide, Walter de la Mare, G.K. Chesterton, Daniel Defoe, and Jean Giono. He refused a chair at the University of Buenos Aires because of his opposition to the Per�n regime. In 1951 he moved to France, where he lived until his death in 1984, dividing his time between Paris and the Proven�al town of Saignon. He accepted President Mitterand's offer of French citizenship in 1981, while insisting that he had not relinquished his Argentine citizenship.<p>Active in Latin American politics, he visited Cuba in 1961 and Nicaragua in 1983; he donated his Prix M�dicis prize money for his novel <b>Libro de Manuel</b> to the United Chilean Front. During most of his years in France he worked for four months as a translator from French and English into Spanish for UNESCO and devoted the rest of the year to his writing and other loves such as the jazz trumpet. He published poems and plays in the thirties and forties but achieved his first major success with a book of stories, <b>Bestiario</b>, in 1951 His novel <b>Rayuela</b> (translated into English as <b>Hopscotch</b> in 1966), was widely praised and won Cort�zar an enthusiastic international following.</p>Text: Spanish</p><h2>Jesus Is the Christ: Studies in the Theology of John</h2><p>More than simply a series of chapters on the theology of John's Gospel, <i>Jesus Is the Christ</i> relates each of John's teachings to his declared aim, expressed in John 20: 30-31: "Jesus did many other signs before his disciples, which have not been written in this book; but these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name." Indeed, each chapter in Morris's book takes up some facet or aspect of John's expressed aim.<br><br>For an age still asking the question "Who is Jesus?" Leon Morris argues convincingly that John's entire Gospel was written to show that the human Jesus is the Christ, or Messiah, as well as the Son of God. But it is Morris's firm conviction that John's purpose was evangelical as well as theological -- that is, John wrote his book so that readers might believe in Christ and as a result have eternal life.</p><p>Leon Morris (1914&#x2013;2006) retired as Principal ofRidley College in Melbourne, Australia, in 1979. He is theauthor of more than forty books, including The ApostolicPreaching of the Cross, the volumes on Matthew andRomans in The Pillar New Testament Commentary, and thevolumes on John and the Thessalonian epistles in the NewInternational Commentary on the New Testament.</p><h2>The Materials and Methods of Sculpture (Dover Art Instruction)</h2><p>"The authority and completeness of the work, the dozens of pertinent plates and textual drawings, add immeasurably to its worth." &#x2014; <i>Magazine of Art<br></i>Before the publication of this book there was a dearth of competent instructional books on the technical aspects of sculpture.

If ready-to-wear doesn't do it for you, let Barbara Deckert teach you how to sew for your plus-size body with <em><strong>Sewing for Plus Sizes</strong></em>. She will guide you through the process of selecting designs, fabrics, and colors that flatter plus- and super-size figures. In addition, you'll get great techniques for sizing up any pattern (even those fancy designer ones!), special concerns for plus-size sewers, and lots of hints and advice make this the most useful sewing book you'll ever own.</p></p><p>Deckert, who designs and makes plus-size fashions, is a frequent contributor to Sew News, Threads, BBW, Radiance, and PACC News. She is a charter member of the Professional Association of Custom Clothiers and has over 30 years of sewing experience.Writes Deckert, "The goal of all plus-size design is to emphasize your positive attributes and modify or distract from those you feel are less desirable." Deckert is herself a plus-sized woman and a custom clothier with more than 30 years of sewing experience. Given that most clothing manufacturers have never learned to design attractive, well-fitting clothes for women who wear a size 14 or larger, the woman who wants to achieve style beyond size must sew her own clothes. This book will make that task less formidable. Illustrated with photos of plus-sized models, including the author herself, this book emphasizes analyzing pattern designs based on individual figure proportions and working effectively with fabric color and texture. Major sections of the book are devoted to tools for plus-sized sewing (including instructions for making an inexpensive personal paper-tape dress form), choosing fabric, taking measurements, "sizing-up" commercial patterns for the plus-sized figure, and modifying patterns to make clothing more comfortable and durable. Enthusiastically recommended for all public libraries with sewing and costuming collections. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Rickover Effect: How One Man Made a Difference</h2><p>More than anyone else, Adm. Hyman G. Rickover made nuclear power a reality. Building on the scientific breakthroughs of the atomic bomb project, he created the nuclear Navy almost overnight, when nearly everyone else thought it was a pipe dream, and built the world's first commercial atomic power station. He did most of this in a single decade. <br><br><p>Rickover's incredible ability to get things done won his program wide public acclaim and personal honors that included presidential citations, honorary doctoral degrees, and congressional gold medals. Despite all this, Rickover was the subject of bitter controversy and was twice passed over for promotions. In 1953 he was saved from involuntary retirement only through congressional intervention. Nearly forty years later, when he was fired as a four-star admiral, all three living American ex-presidents attended his post-retirement party. <br><br></p><p>Now, for the first time, one of Rickover's close associates tells what it was like to be with this remarkable man day and night as he accomplished his miracles, and why he was bitterly opposed by so many powerful people. Theodore Rockwell, the admiral's long time technical director, takes the reader behind the "zirconium curtain" that protected the program to give an inside account of those turbulent times. Using on-the-spot anecdotes and little-known documents, he explores Rickover's methods and relationships with others to help us understand his strengths and weaknesses. <br><br></p><p>The author describes Rickover's successes beginning right after World War II in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. His account includes the first submarine voyage from Pearl Harbor to England to the North Pole, the continuously submerged round-the-world journey of the USS <i>Triton</i>, and the buildup of the U.S. nuclear fleet and the civilian nuclear power industry. <br><br></p><p>This candid, insightful portrait could only have been written by a key player. The Rickover Effect makes and important contribution to the understanding to one of this century's most elusive personalities.<br></p></p><p>Theodore Rockwell has been directly involved in nuclear power for nearly half a century. After completing his master's degree in chemical engineering at Princeton in 1944, he worked on the atomic bomb project at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. <br><br>In 1949 he joined Rickover's Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program, where he became director of the Nuclear Technology Division. In 1954 he was made technical director, helping to assure the safe operation of nuclear-powered naval vessels and the creation of the world's first commercial nuclear-power plant. He left the program in 1964 to set up an engineering firm with two colleagues in Washington, D.C.<br><br><p>In 1960 Rockwell was awarded an honorary ScD degree for his contributions to the development of atomic power. He earned distinguished service medals from the Navy and the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, an "Award for Exemplary Achievement in Public Administration" from the William A. Jump Foundation, and the first "Lifetime Contribution Award", henceforth known as the "Rockwell Award" from the American Nuclear Society. He is editor of <i>The Reactor Shielding Design Manual</i> and coauthor of <i>The Shippingport Pressurized Water Reactor </i> and Arms Control Agreements. He has written numerous technical papers and several magazine articles, including "Frontier Life Among the Atom Splitters" for <i>Saturday Evening Post</i>, "Bred for Fury" for<i> Time</i>, and "Heresy, Excommunications and Other Weeds" for <i>New Realities</i>.<br><br></p>Rockwell, Rickover's former technical director, has written a notable, anecdote-rich biography of the controversial "father of the nuclear navy." In 1951 Hyman G. Rickover (1900-1986), then an obscure captain in the navy's Bureau of Ships, set himself the task of creating an atomic submarine. Four-and-a-half years later, USS Nautilus, the world's first nuclear sub, joined the fleet. In lay language, Rockwell explains how he accomplished this amazing feat. For one thing, Rickover gave new meaning to the concept of industrial quality control. Rockwell also makes clear why his former boss was widely hated and feared, and provides examples of his unique ability to infuriate as well as inspire. Most prominently, Rockwell demonstrates Rickover's genius for getting things done. Finally, he relates the strange story of Rickover's enforced retirement in 1982 at the instigation of Navy Secretary John Lehman, who accused him of accepting favors from contractors. If this fine biography has a flaw, it is the author's failure to explain adequately why Lehman was so implacably hostile to the man who immeasurably strengthened the United States Navy.

I should emphasize right from the start that I will not address this question in its full human depth, but will approach it from a strictly scientific perspective; and even then, my focus will at first be narrowed down to life as a biological phenomenon. Within this restricted framework, the question may be rephrased as: "What are the defining characteristics of living systems?"<br><br>Social scientists might prefer to proceed in the opposite order--first identifying the defining characteristics of social reality, and then extending into the biological domain and integrating it with corresponding concepts in the natural sciences. This would no doubt be possible, but having been trained in the natural sciences and having previously developed a synthesis of the new conception of life in these disciplines, it is natural for me to begin there.<br><br>I could also argue that, after all, social reality evolved out of the biological world between two and four million years ago, when a species of "Southern apes" (<i>Australopithecus afarensis</i>) stood up and began to walk on two legs. At that time, the early hominids developed complex brains, toolmaking skills and language, while the helplessness of their prematurely born infants led to the formation of the supportive families and communities that became the foundation of human social life. Hence, it makes sense to ground the understanding of social phenomena in a unified conception of the evolution of life and consciousness.<br><br> Focus on Cells<br><br>When we look at the enormous variety of living organisms--animals, plants, people, microorganisms--we immediately make an important discovery: all biological life consists of cells. Without cells, there is no life on this Earth. This may not always have been so--and I shall come back to this question--but today we can say confidently that all life involves cells.<br><br>This discovery allows us to adopt a strategy that is typical of the scientific method. To identify the defining characteristics of life, we look for and then study the simplest system that displays these characteristics. This reductionist strategy has proved very effective in science--provided that one does not fall into the trap of thinking that complex entities are nothing but the sum of their simpler parts.<br><br> Since we know that all living organisms are either single cells or multicellular, we know that the simplest living system is<br> the cell. More precisely, it is a bacterial cell. We know today that all higher forms of life have evolved from bacterial cells. The simplest of these belong to a family of tiny spherical bacteria known as mycoplasm, with diameters less than a thousandth of a millimeter and genomes consisting of a single closed loop of double-stranded DNA. Yet even in these minimal cells, a complex network of metabolic processes is ceaselessly at work, transporting nutrients in and waste out of the cell, and continually using food molecules to build proteins and other cell components.<br><br> Although mycoplasm are minimal cells in terms of their internal simplicity, they can only survive in a precise and rather complex chemical environment. As biologist Harold Morowitz points out, this means that we need to distinguish between two kinds of cellular simplicity.6 Internal simplicity means that the biochemistry of the organism's internal environment is simple, while ecological simplicity means that the organism makes few chemical demands on its external environment.<br><br> From the ecological point of view, the simplest bacteria are the cyanobacteria, the ancestors of blue-green algae, which are also among the oldest bacteria, their chemical traces being present in the earliest fossils. Some of these blue-green bacteria are able to build up their organic compounds entirely from carbon dioxide, water, nitrogen and pure minerals. Interestingly, their great ecological simplicity seems to require a certain amount of internal biochemical complexity.<br><br> The Ecological Perspective<br><br> The relationship between internal and ecological simplicity is still poorly understood, partly because most biologists are not used to the ecological perspective. As Morowitz explains:<br><br> Sustained life is a property of an ecological system rather than a single organism or species. Traditional biology has ended to concentrate attention on individual organisms rather than on the biological continuum. The origin of life is thus looked for as a unique event in which an organism arises from the surrounding milieu. A more ecologically balanced point of view would examine the proto-ecological cycles and subsequent chemical systems that must have developed and flourished while objects resembling organisms appeared.<br><br> No individual organism can exist in isolation. Animals depend on the photosynthesis of plants for their energy needs; plants depend on the carbon dioxide produced by animals, as well as on the nitrogen fixed by the bacteria at their roots; and together plants, animals and microorganisms regulate the entire biosphere and maintain the conditions conducive to life. According to the Gaia theory of James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis, the evolution of the first living organisms went hand in hand with the transformation of the planetary surface from an inorganic environment to a self-regulating biosphere. "In that sense," writes Harold Morowitz, "life is a property of planets rather than of individual organisms."<br><br> Life Defined in Terms of DNA<br><br> Let us now return to the question "What is life?" and ask: How does a bacterial cell work? What are its defining characteristics? When we look at a cell under an electron microscope, we notice that its metabolic processes involve special macromolecules--very large molecules consisting of long chains of hundreds of atoms. Two kinds of these macromolecules are found in all cells: proteins and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA).<br><br> In the bacterial cell, there are essentially two types of proteins--enzymes, which act as catalysts of various metabolic processes, and structural proteins, which are part of the cell structure. In higher organisms, there are also many other types of proteins with specialized functions, such as the antibodies of the immune system or the hormones.<br><br>Since most metabolic processes are catalyzed by enzymes and enzymes are specified by genes, the cellular processes are genetically controlled, which gives them great stability. The RNA molecules serve as messengers, delivering coded information for the synthesis of enzymes from the DNA, thus establishing the critical link between the cell's genetic and metabolic features.<br><br> DNA is also responsible for the cell's self-replication, which is a crucial characteristic of life. Without it, any accidentally formed structures would have decayed and disappeared, and life could never have evolved. This overriding importance of DNA might suggest that it should be identified as <i>the</i> single defining characteristic of life. We might simply say: "Living systems are chemical systems that contain DNA."<br><br> The problem with this definition is that dead cells also contain DNA. Indeed, DNA molecules may be preserved for hundreds, even thousands, of years after the organism dies. A spectacular example of such a case was reported a few years ago, when scientists in Germany succeeded in identifying the precise gene sequence in DNA from a Neanderthal skull--bones that had been dead for over 100,000 years! Thus, the presence of DNA alone is not sufficient to define life. At the very least, our definition would have to be modified to: "Living systems are chemical systems that contain DNA, and which are not dead." But then we would be saying, essentially, "a living system is a system that is alive"--a mere tautology.<br><br> This little exercise shows us that the molecular structures of the cell are not sufficient for the definition of life. We also need to describe the cell's metabolic processes--in other words, the patterns of relationships between the macromolecules. In this approach, we focus on the cell as a whole rather than on its parts. According to biochemist Pier Luigi Luisi, whose special field of research is molecular evolution and the origin of life, these two approaches--the "DNA-centered" view and the "cell-centered" view--represent two main philosophical and experimental streams in life sciences today.<br><br> Membranes--The Foundation of Cellular Identity<br><br>Let us now look at the cell as a whole. A cell is characterized, first of all, by a boundary (the cell membrane) which discriminates between the system--the "self," as it were--and its environment. Within this boundary, there is a network of chemical reactions (the cell's metabolism) by which the system sustains itself.<br><br> Most cells have other boundaries besides membranes, such as rigid cell walls or capsules. These are common features in many kinds of cells, but only membranes are a universal feature of cellular life. Since its beginning, life on Earth has been associated with water. Bacteria move in water, and the metabolism inside their membranes takes place in a watery environment. In such fluid surroundings, a cell could never persist as a distinct entity without a physical barrier against free diffusion. The existence of membranes is therefore an essential condition for cellular life. Membranes are not only a universal characteristic of life, but also display the same type of structure throughout the living world. We shall see that the molecular details of this universal membrane structure hold important clues about the origin of life.<br><br> A membrane is very different from a cell wall. Whereas cell walls are rigid structures, membranes are always active, opening and closing continually, keeping certain substances out and letting others in. The cell's metabolic reaction involve a variety of ions, and the membrane, by being semipermeable, controls their proportions and keeps them in balance. Another critical activity of the membrane is to continually pump out excessive calcium waste, so that the calcium remaining within the cell is kept at the precise, very low level required for its metabolic functions. All these activities help to maintain the cell as a distinct entity and protect it from harmful environmental influences. Indeed, the first thing a bacterium does when it is attacked by another organism is to make membranes.<br><br> All nucleated cells, and even most bacteria, also have internal membranes. In textbooks, a plant or animal cell is usually pictured as a large disk, surrounded by the cell membrane and containing a number of smaller disks (the organelles) each surrounded by its own membrane. This picture is not really accurate. The cell does not contain several distinct membranes, but rather has one single, interconnected membrane system. This so-called "endomembrane system" is always in motion, wrapping itself around all the organelles and going out to the edge of the cell. It is a moving "conveyor belt" that is continually produced, broken down and produced again.<br><br>Through its various activities the cellular membrane regulates the cell's molecular composition and thus preserves its identity. There is an interesting parallel here to recent thinking in immunology. Some immunologists now believe that the central role of the immune system is to control and regulate the molecular repertoire throughout the organism, thus maintaining the organism's "molecular identity." At the cellular level, the cell membrane plays a similar role. It regulates molecular compositions and, in doing so, maintains the cellular identity.<br><br> Self-generation<br><br> The cell membrane is the first defining characteristic of cellular life. The second characteristic is the nature of the metabolism that takes place within the cell boundary. In the words of microbiologist Lynn Margulis: "Metabolism, the incessant chemistry of self-maintenance, is an essential feature of life . . . Through ceaseless metabolism, through chemical and energy flow, life continuously produces, repairs, and perpetuates itself. Only cells, and organisms composed of cells, metabolize."<br><br> When we take a closer look at the processes of metabolism, we notice that they form a chemical network. This is another fundamental feature of life. As ecosystems are understood in terms of food webs (networks of organisms), so organisms are viewed as networks of cells, organs and organ systems, and cells as networks of molecules. One of the key insights of the systems approach has been the realization that the network is a pattern that is common to all life. Wherever we see life, we see networks.<br><br>The metabolic network of a cell involves very special dynamics that differ strikingly from the cell's nonliving environment. Taking in nutrients from the outside world, the cell sustains itself by means of a network of chemical reactions that take place inside the boundary and produce all of the cell's components, including those of the boundary itself.<br><br>The function of each component in this network is to transform or replace other components, so that the entire network continually generates itself. This is the key to the systemic definition of life: living networks continually create, or re-create, themselves by transforming or replacing their components. In this way they undergo continual structural changes while preserving their weblike patterns of organization.<br><br>The dynamic of self-generation was identified as a key characteristic of life by biologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela, who gave it the name "autopoiesis" (literally, "self-making"). The concept of autopoiesis combines the two defining characteristics of cellular life mentioned above, the physical boundary and the metabolic network. Unlike the surfaces of crystals or large molecules, the boundary of an autopoietic system is chemically distinct from the rest of the system, and it participates in metabolic processes by assembling itself and by selectively filtering incoming and outgoing molecules.<br><br>The definition of a living system as an autopoietic network means that the phenomenon of life has to be understood as a property of the system as a whole. In the words of Pier Luigi Luisi, "Life cannot be ascribed to any single molecular component (not even DNA or RNA!) but only to the entire bounded metabolic network."<br><br>Autopoiesis provides a clear and powerful criterion for distinguishing between living and nonliving systems. For example, it tells us that viruses are not alive, because they lack their own metabolism. Outside living cells, viruses are inert molecular structures consisting of proteins and nucleic acids. A virus is essentially a chemical message that needs the metabolisof a living host cell to produce new virus particles, according to the instructions encoded in its DNA or RNA. The new particles are not built within the boundary of the virus itself, but outside in the host cell.<br><br>Similarly, a robot that assembles other robots out of parts that are built by some other machines cannot be considered living. In recent years, it has often been suggested that computers and other automata may constitute future life-forms. However, unless they were able to synthesize their components from "food molecules" in their environment, they could not be considered to be alive according to our definition of life.<br><br> The Cellular Network<br><br>As soon as we begin to describe the metabolic network of a cell in detail, we see that it is very complex indeed, even for the simplest bacteria. Most metabolic processes are facilitated (ca...</p><h2>Manuscript Makeover: Revision Techniques No Fiction Writer Can Afford to Ignore</h2><p>Professional editor and author Elizabeth Lyon offers aspiring novelists the guidance and instruction they need to write and edit well-crafted and compelling stories that will stand out from the competition and attract the attention of agents and publishers, including: <br><br> - Stand-out style techniques, from accessing an authentic voice to applying techniques of "wordsmithing" that transform prose<br> - How to rewrite characterization for dimensionality, a universal need, and theme<br> - Adjustment suggestions to match the prose style and structure of specific genres<br> - Correct grammar, punctuation, spelling, and style<br> - Strategies to strengthen story beginnings and endings<br> - Methods for increasing plot stakes, creating movement, and adjusting pace for maximum suspense</p><p>Elizabeth Lyon, a regular speaker at writing conferences and retreats nationwide, has been a contributor to <b>Writer&#x2019;s Digest</b> and is a mentor, editor, and teacher for many writers.

In this third, equally entertaining installment, Riordan casts Navarre according to the other piece of his quirky skill set: his Ph.D. in English literature from UC Berkeley. <p> While the worst-case scenario envisioned by most professors at the University of Texas at San Antonio probably involves lost essays or a failed tenure bid, recently the medievalists at UTSA have wound up deader than their favorite language. At first, the deaths seemed like accidents. Dr. Theodore Haimer was forced to take an early retirement when his remarks about "the damn coddled Mexicans at UTSA" found their way into the <i>Express-News</i>. Shortly thereafter, the old man was discovered deceased, his head in a bowl of Apple Jacks, the result of an apparent heart attack. His successor, the young Dr. Aaron Brandon, continued to receive the vituperation and death threats that had followed his predecessor to the grave. Then, halfway into the semester, Brandon was also found dead--murdered. Now, Tres Nevarre is the only man crazy enough to fill the vacant chair of Chaucer studies and murder avoidance at the amiable institution. His first day on the job is the clincher: an exploding package leaves him both scarred and excited for the only academic job he's ever found that rivals Indiana Jones's.</p><p> Riordan's style blends the hipness of Elmore Leonard with the sardonic humor of Janet Evanovich. And like Evanovich, Riordan draws on the colorful character of his locale--in his case the twangy chili con carnage of San Antonio academic life--to pepper his narrative with a mixture of medieval literature, Tex-Mex dialogue, and Sherlock Holmesian puzzles. While there aren't many more awards for Riordan to conquer, <i>The Last King of Texas</i> will certainly win him some more loyal fans. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>Multiple-award-winning author Rick Riordan brings back smart-mouthed Texas P.I.

Many congregations have been participating in a renaissance of worship known as the "liturgical movement" and have reclaimed worship forms that have served the church for centuries. Yet because the church today is operating in a radically changed cultural environment, many people in our society do not understand liturgical worship and thus we must find language, music, themes, and images that speak to the unchurched, spiritually seeking person. In Beyond the Worship Wars, Thomas G.

I can be at a backyard barbecue or at a New Year's Eve party or in the waiting room at the dentist's office, or my husband's baseball game. <em>You must see so much,</em> they say, shaking their heads, lips pursed in something like empathy, like <em>I</em> was the one who might have endured the beatings, the burns, the torrents of hateful words. Of course I don't share any details about my clients and their families. So much has been stripped from the children that stagger in and out of my orbit; the very least I can do is honor their privacy. <em>Come on,</em> people urge, <em>tell me. It's bad, isn't it?</em> Like I'm dangling some salacious gossip in front of them. Like I'm keeping mum because I don't want to offend their tender ears, upset their perfectly ordered worlds where all children are touched with gentle hands, spoken to with loving words and tucked warmly into beds with full stomachs.<br><br><em>Close your eyes,</em> I once told the shortstop's mother and she did, almost quivering in anticipation of the gory details. She nodded in compliance, cocking her head in my direction, preparing for what I will reveal next. Will I tell her about Mariah Crane, the seven-year-old whose mother held her head under water until there was no chance that her damaged brain could ever catch up with her growing body? Or will I tell them about the twins? Everyone has heard about the <em>Twin Case,</em> as it's still known. Everyone wants to know more about the twins.<br><br><em>Now imagine the vilest things that can be done to a human being,</em> I say. I let her think about this for a moment and I can see the slight spasm of revulsion skitter across her face. <em>That's what I've seen.</em> She opens one eye to see if I'll say anything else. But that's all I have for her.<br><br>The only people I talk to about the Twin Case are my husband and Joe Gaddey. I was a newly minted social worker, just out of graduate school when I moved back to my hometown of Cedar City, the second largest city in Iowa, just behind Des Moines with a population of about one hundred ninety-five thousand. My husband moved to Cedar City to teach high school history and coach baseball, having grown up in the tiny town of Broken Branch, Iowa, where everyone is related, if not by blood then by marriage. We met through mutual friends and eventually settled into married life, ready to change the world. In the end I have struggled to not let the case change me.<br><br>Adam and I hadn't even met yet when I was assigned my first social work case involving a set of six-year-old twin boys, a five-year-old girl, their mother, their father and a baseball bat. Only one of the boys survived. The family wasn't new to the system; I had inherited the case from my predecessor and arrived for the first of my scheduled visits just as the emergency personnel were bringing out the first stretcher. Joe Gaddey was the officer positioned outside the front door. In a daze I moved toward him.<br><br>"And you are?" he asked. I couldn't even speak, could only look up at him. I peeked around his solid girth, trying to peer into the house and was greeted with a terrible sight. I teetered on my high heels and grabbed on to his sleeve for support. "Whoa, now," he said, steadying me. "You don't want to see that."<br><br>"I'm their social worker," I said in a small voice. "What happened?"<br><br>"Their dad happened," he said in that wry way I have grown to appreciate over the years. I swallowed back the bile that had collected in my throat, willing myself not to vomit. I knew this job would be difficult, even heartbreaking, but nothing, nothing, had prepared me for this. I felt the police officer's gaze on me. He was massive. Six-three, two hundred and ten pounds of muscle, a thirty-six-year-old with a baby face and a sharp tongue. "You going to be okay?" he asked. We stood there for a moment. Me nodding my chin up and down like some maniacal bobblehead doll and the officer standing there uncomfortably. "You should probably call your supervisor," he finally said as the second, third and fourth stretchers emerged, shrouded in black body bags, two of which were child-sized.<br><br>"Yeah," I said, still nodding.<br><br>Every day I chronicle the monstrosities inflicted upon children in volumes of paperwork, in endless meetings, while testifying in court. I rarely talk to my husband about my clients anymore. He can see what kind of day I've had by the look on my face, the sag of my shoulders, how quickly I make a beeline to the bottle of pinot grigio I've reserved expressly for the more difficult days. On these days, Adam understands that there are no words and will gently replace my wineglass with our eleven-month-old daughter. Avery will wrap her chubby arms around my neck and press her petal-pink lips against my cheek so that I can smell the scent of apples on her breath. Whenever I come through the door it's like Christmas, her birthday and the Fourth ofJuly all at once, she is always so happy to see me. I could take comfort in this, and I do, but I see the same delight on the faces of the children I work with who are reunited with a mother or father. The same mothers or fathers who once slapped them so hard that teeth were loosened or grabbed them so roughly that bones were broken. In Avery I see the same spark that's in their eyes, the eruption of the same joyful grin. <em>I knew you'd come back to me,</em> their faces say. I know the psychology behind this&#x2014;why an abused child will run into the arms of their abuser&#x2014;but it makes me sad.<br><br>There is one case I do not talk about anymore, one that I am not able to speak of, not to Adam, not even to Joe. It was a case that I knew would end badly... I felt it in my bones the moment I walked into the home, and I was right.<br><br>Madalyn Olmstead did not have an easy entrance into this world, nor did she have a gentle exit. Madalyn was born at Cedar City Hospital six years ago and spent the first ten days of her life in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for respiratory issues. I became involved when Madalyn was one and a home health-care nurse called my supervisor at the Department of Human Services and asked if someone could check in with Madalyn and her mother at their home. I was assigned the case. When pressed for details, the nurse was vague. "Madalyn needs to use a nebulizer for her asthma, but her mother has a hard time remembering what I tell her. I think she might have trouble reading but is a quick learner when someone shows her what to do. She seems great with Madalyn." The nurse was quiet for a moment. "Honestly, it's the husband I'm worried about. It's like when he comes into the room all the air is sucked out. She becomes tense and all her attention goes right to the husband. He acts like a jealous sibling or something. He has no interest in Madalyn but to complain about how much time his wife is spending with her. She seemed scared of him. Can't you just go over there and check? I'd feel so much better."<br><br>As a social worker, I was obligated to follow through, though based on what the nurse shared, I didn't think I'd find anything that was actionable, but at least the father would know that someone was paying attention to the way he was interacting with his wife and his daughter. Three years later Madalyn was dead and I knew James Olmstead had killed her and he got away with it.<br><br>Most often Madalyn comes to me in the violet-tinged mornings. That middling space between night and day. She has the sweet, unformed features of a toddler and sparkling gray eyes recessed above full, pink cheeks. Surprisingly, considering the way she was found, it wasn't the most gruesome of deaths&#x2014;very little blood and only a few bruises marred her perfect little body. It was the hidden, internal injuries that killed Madalyn. Still Madalyn's short time on earth began with the violent expulsion from her mother's womb into the cold, unforgiving earthly air and ended in violence, as well. It just couldn't be proved. I knew differently and I think her mother did, too. Though she was too blind, too scared, to say so.<br><br>When I wake up in the mornings, as the memory of Madalyn creeps beneath the covers with me and my snoring husband, my children sleeping soundly in the rooms down the hall, over and over I try to parse out just how her father, James Olmstead, got away with murder.<br><br>I'd been in and out of the Olmstead home for years because of suspected abuse by the father. Neighbors to the Olmsteads would call the police because of loud fighting coming from the house. Twice Madalyn had to be removed from the home because the father had beaten the mother so badly. Twice, the mother didn't press charges. Twice, Madalyn was returned to the home. There were contusions on Madalyn, but the kind you find on all children: skinned knees, bruised elbows, purple knots on the forehead. All explained away by Madalyn's mother. <em>Such a busy little girl. You have children, right?</em><br><br>She was right, I do have children. Just before Madalyn died, Lucas was four and Leah was seven and they had the exact same kind of bruises. But as social workers, we know. We know which homes hold the addicts, the predators, the abusers. We just can't always prove it.<br><br>Two years ago, on a beautiful May afternoon, Madalyn Olmstead tumbled out of the third-story window of her apartment building and fell to the concrete sidewalk below. The only other person in the apartment at the time was her father.<br><br>"She was out of my sight for only a second," her father claimed. "She thought she could fly," he cried convincingly to the news cameras. During the autopsy, besides the traumatic head injury, the medical examiner found suspicious bruising on Madalyn but not suspicious enough to call it murder. Because of his neglect, Madalyn's father was arrested for child endangerment that resulted in the death of a child and was facing up to a fifty-year prison sentence.<br><br>Even though I was convinced this was no accident, at the time I was satisfied that James Olmstead was being tried for the lesser charge and would have been content just having him put in prison. I prepared to testify against James. Over and over I reviewed the documentation of my visits to the Olm-stead home, practiced describing the injuries I saw on Madalyn's mother, the suspicious bruises I saw on Madalyn. The jury never heard my testimony. It can be very difficult for the prosecution to get a defendant's prior bad acts entered into evidence, and the judge in this case felt that the facts would prejudice the jury too much. Our only hope was that the defense would open the door by providing testimony that it was all a mistake, that James's character was much different than what he was alleged to have done. That he just wasn't capable of hurting his daughter. The defense didn't open that door, didn't bring James's moral fiber into testimony, didn't have his wife or his co-workers at the foundry where he worked, nor the parents of children he coached in Tiny Tot T-Ball, speak on his behalf. Didn't have James testify on his own behalf. As a result, the jurors were not allowed to hear of James's abu-siveness. He was acquitted. Too much reasonable doubt, the jury foreperson explained after the trial was over.<br><br>Three months later, James and his wife sued the owner of the apartment building for not insuring that the window screens were safely installed. They won a tidy sum of money and were from then on known as the victims.<br><br>I just knew that James had beaten his daughter and then panicked. In my gut I knew he made it look like she had climbed onto the windowsill, fallen through the screen and tumbled three stories to the sidewalk below. Madalyn was a fear-filled little girl. She was afraid of water, was afraid of dogs, was afraid of strangers, and was, most likely, afraid of heights. There was no way that Madalyn Olmstead would climb onto a windowsill and press her little hands against the screen. Never once in all the time I spent with her did she ever tell me she wished she could be a bird, wished she could fly. One thing I knew of for sure was that Madalyn was afraid of her father.<br><br>Months after the trial, not Caren, my supervisor, not Joe, not even my husband would listen to me rant and rave about my suspicions anymore. "Didn't the medical examiner say her injuries were consistent with an accidental fall?" Adam asked when I brought up my concerns for about the millionth time. I tried to explain that the medical examiner at the time was overworked and had a reputation of taking the lazy way out in determining his findings. Adam wasn't sympathetic. "Ellen," he said, "you're making yourself sick over this. You need to stop worrying about this kid. No one else seems to be."<br><br>Adam's lack of concern irked me a bit, but Caren's and Joe's dismissal truly hurt. In social work and police work, too, we not only deal with facts but gut instinct often prods us into action. I thought they would listen to my worries and would back me up when I suggested another in-depth investigation into Madalyn's death. They were sympathetic, made all the right noises when I made my case to them, but in the end they said they were satisfied with the jury's decision and I needed to drop it.<br><br>In the end all that was left was the man who got away with murder, the woman who chose to protect him, and me, the social worker who was powerless to protect a four-year-old little girl named Madalyn Olmstead, who will forever be known as <em>Little Bird, the little girl who thought she could fly.</em></p><h2>THE FLOWER SHOW MURDER an addictive crime mystery full of twists (Monica Noble Detective)</h2><p><b>Discover a new series of murder mysteries set in an idyllic English village.

The symbol of the way embodies the aspect of process and brings out christology&#39;s alignment towards its goal. This symbol can comprehend Christ&#39;s way from his birth in the Spirit and his baptism in the Spirit to his self-surrender on Golgotha. It also makes it possible to understand the path of Christ as the way leading from his resurrection to his parousia-the way he takes in the Spirit to Israel, to the nations, and into the breadth and depth of the cosmos. 2. The symbol of the way makes us aware that every human christology is historically conditioned and limited. Every human christology is a &#39;christology of the way,&#39; not yet a &#39;christology of the home country,&#39; a christology of faith, not yet a christology of sight. So christology is no more than the beginning of eschatology; and eschatology, as the Christian faith understands it, is always the consummation of christology. 3. Finally, but not least important: every way is an invitation. A way is something to be followed. &#39;The way of Jesus Christ&#39; is not merely a christological category. It is an ethical category too. Anyone who enters upon Christ&#39;s way will discover who Jesus really is; and anyone who really believes in Jesus and the Christ of God will follow him along the way he himself took. Christology and christopraxis find one another in the full and completed knowledge of Christ. This christology links dogmatics and ethics in closer detail than in the previous volumes.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>The Baltic Prize: Thomas Kydd 19</h2><p><p><b>1808.</b> Parted from his new bride, Captain Sir Thomas Kydd is called away to join the Northern Expedition to Sweden, now Britain's only ally in the Baltic.

Moving beyond the standard framework of Cold War competition and national resurgence, Klaus M�hlhahn situates twenty-first-century China in the nation&#x2019;s long history of creative adaptation.</p><p>In the mid-eighteenth century, when the Qing Empire reached the height of its power, China dominated a third of the world&#x2019;s population and managed its largest economy. But as the Opium Wars threatened the nation&#x2019;s sovereignty from without and the Taiping Rebellion ripped apart its social fabric from within, China found itself verging on free fall. A network of family relations, economic interdependence, institutional innovation, and structures of governance allowed citizens to regain their footing in a convulsing world. In China&#x2019;s drive to reclaim regional centrality, its leaders looked outward as well as inward, at industrial developments and international markets offering new ways to thrive.</p><p>This dynamic legacy of overcoming adversity and weakness is apparent today in China&#x2019;s triumphs&#x2015;but also in its most worrisome trends. Telling a story of crisis and recovery, <i>Making China Modern </i>explores the versatility and resourcefulness that matters most to China&#x2019;s survival, and to its future possibilities.</p></p><p>Klaus M�hlhahn is Professor of Chinese History and Culture and Vice President at the Free University of Berlin.

Here, available for the first time in paperback, are all of Kandinsky's writings on art, newly translated into English. Editors Kenneth C. Lindsay and Peter Vergo have taken their translations directly from Kandinsky's original texts, and have included select interviews, lecture notes, and newly discovered items along with his more formal writings. The pieces range from one-page essays to the book-length treatises <i>On the Spiritual in Art</i> (1911) and <i>Point and Line to Plane</i> (1926), and are arranged in chronological order from 1901 to 1943. The poetry, good enough to stand on its literary merits, is presented with all the original accompanying illustrations. And the book's design follows Kandinsky's intentions, preserving the spirit of the original typography and layout.<br>Kandinsky was nearly thirty before he bravely gave up an academic career in law for his true passion, painting. Though his art was marked by extraordinarily varied styles, Kandinsky sought a pure art throughout, one which would express the soul, or "inner necessity," of the artist. His uncompromising search for an art which would elicit a response to itself rather than to the object depicted resulted in the birth of nonobjective art-and in these writings, Kandinsky offered the first cogent explanation of his aims. His language was characterized by its desire for vivification, of the infusion of life into mundane things.<br>Considered as a whole, Kandinsky's writings exceed all expectations of what an artist should accomplish with words. Not only do his ideas and observations make us rethink the nature of art and the way it reflects the aspirations of his era, but they touch on matters vital to the situation of the human soul.</p><p><b>Kenneth C. Lindsay</b> is Professor Emeritus of the State University of New York in Binghamton.

Through a fascinating mixture of cultural and scientific history, food politics, and culinary detective work, Bee Wilson uncovers the many ways swindlers have cheapened, falsified, and even poisoned our food throughout history. In the hands of people and corporations who have prized profits above the health of consumers, food and drink have been tampered with in often horrifying ways--padded, diluted, contaminated, substituted, mislabeled, misnamed, or otherwise faked. <i>Swindled</i> gives a panoramic view of this history, from the leaded wine of the ancient Romans to today's food frauds--such as fake organics and the scandal of Chinese babies being fed bogus milk powder.</p><br><p> Wilson pays special attention to nineteenth- and twentieth-century America and England and their roles in developing both industrial-scale food adulteration and the scientific ability to combat it. As <i>Swindled</i> reveals, modern science has both helped and hindered food fraudsters--increasing the sophistication of scams but also the means to detect them. The big breakthrough came in Victorian England when a scientist first put food under the microscope and found that much of what was sold as "genuine coffee" was anything but--and that you couldn't buy pure mustard in all of London.</p><br><p> Arguing that industrialization, laissez-faire politics, and globalization have all hurt the quality of food, but also that food swindlers have always been helped by consumer ignorance, <i>Swindled</i> ultimately calls for both governments and individuals to be more vigilant. In fact, Wilson suggests, one of our best protections is simply to reeducate ourselves about the joys of food and cooking.</p></p><p><p>"Bee Wilson is a terrific writer who tells great stories, and her book could not be more timely given what's going on in the Chinese food industry today."<b>--Marion Nestle, author of <i>Food Politics</i> and <i>What to Eat</i></b></p><p>"No other book tells the history of food adulteration in this way. <i>Swindled</i> is ambitious in its coverage and extremely well written."<b>--Andrew F.

Now he has assembled this equally lively companion anthology for all those readers who&#39;ve wanted more poems that touch the heart, stir the mind and fire the spirit. &#39;Being Alive&#39; is about being human: about love and loss, fear and longing, hurt and wonder. &#39;Staying Alive&#39; didn&#39;t just reach a broader readership, it introduced thousands of new readers to contemporary poetry, giving them an international gathering of poems of great personal force, poems with emotional power, intellectual edge and playful wit. It also brought many readers back to poetry, people who hadn&#39;t read poetry for years because it hadn&#39;t held their interest. &#39;Being Alive&#39; gives readers an even wider selection of vivid, brilliantly diverse contemporary poetry from around the world. A third companion anthology, &#39;Being Human&#39; (2011), completes this modern poetry trilogy.</p><p>&#39;I love Staying Alive and keep going back to it. Being Alive is just as vivid, strongly present and equally beautifully organised. But this new book feels even more alive - I think it has a heartbeat, or maybe that&#39;s my own thrum humming along with the music of these poets. Sitting alone in a room with these poems is to be assured that you are not alone, you are not crazy (or if you are, you&#39;re not the only one who thinks this way!) I run home to this book to argue with it, find solace in it, to locate myself in the world again&#39; - Meryl Streep. &#39;These poems remind us of what we have felt yet never fully articulated, what we have dreamt yet never believed entirely possible. Perhaps most importantly, the poems in here tell us there is nothing more powerful than language when its agenda is to reveal rather than to conceal or distort&#39; - Kamila Shamsie. &#39;Hopefully, books like this will put poetry back into the mainstream&#39; - Van Morrison.</p><h2>How to Lead Small Groups (LifeChange)</h2><p>Whether you are a veteran or a new small-group leader, this book will provide you with the leadership skills, tools, and information you need.

Then, a murdered policeman leaves a clue folded in a newspaper, and Wolfe has to read the fine print to decipher his killer&#x2019;s identity. And what do you do when a chimp is the only witness to a crime? This is no time for monkeyshines from the world&#x2019;s most celebrated armchair detective.</p><p><b>Rex Stout</b> (1886&#x2013;1975) wrote dozens of short stories, novellas, and full-length mystery novels, most featuring his two indelible characters, the peerless detective Nero Wolfe and his handy sidekick, Archie Goodwin.I<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Our nephew Arthur was the romantic type,&#x201d; said Mrs. Benjamin Rackell with the least possible movement of her thin tight lips. &#x201c;He thought being a Communist was romantic.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Nero Wolfe, behind his desk in his outsized chair that thought nothing of his seventh of a ton, scowled at her. I, at my own desk with a notebook and pen, permitted myself a private grin, not unsympathetic. Wolfe was controlling himself under severe provocation. The appointment for Mr. Rackell to call at Wolfe&#x2019;s office on the ground floor of his old brownstone house on West Thirty-fifth Street, at six p.m., had been made by phone by a secretary in the office of the Rackell Importing Company, and nothing had been said about a wife coming along. And the wife, no treat as a spectacle to begin with, was an interrupter and a clich� tosser, enough to make Wolfe scowl at any man, let alone a woman.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But,&#x201d; he objected, not too caustic, &#x201c;you say that he was not a Communist, that, on the contrary, he was acting for the FBI when he joined the Communist party.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He would have loved to tell her to get lost. But his house had five stories, counting the basement and the plant rooms full of orchids on the roof, and there was Fritz the chef and Theodore the botanist and me, Archie Goodwin, the fairly confidential assistant, with nothing to carry the load but his income as a private detective; and the Rackell check for three thousand bucks, offered as a retainer, was under a paperweight on his desk.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s just it,&#x201d; Mrs. Rackell said impatiently. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it romantic to work for the FBI? But that wasn&#x2019;t why he did it; he did it to serve his country, and that&#x2019;s why they killed him. His being the romantic type had nothing to do with it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Wolfe made a face and undertook to bypass her. His eyes went to Rackell. She would probably have called her husband the stubby type, with his short arms and legs, but he was no runt. His trunk was long and broad and his head long and narrow. His eyes pointed down at the corners, and so did his mouth, making him look mournful.<br> &nbsp;<br> Wolfe asked him, &#x201c;Have you spoken with the FBI, Mr. Rackell?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But the wife answered. &#x201c;No, he hasn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I went myself yesterday, and I never heard anything to equal it. They wouldn&#x2019;t tell me a single thing. They wouldn&#x2019;t even admit Arthur was working for them as a spy for his country! They said it was a matter for the New York police and I should talk to them&#x2014;as if I hadn&#x2019;t!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I told you, Pauline,&#x201d; Rackell said mildly but not timidly, &#x201c;that the FBI won&#x2019;t tell people things. And the police won&#x2019;t either, not when it&#x2019;s murder, and especially when the Communists come into it. That&#x2019;s why I insisted on coming to Nero Wolfe to find out what&#x2019;s going on. If the FBI doesn&#x2019;t want it known that Arthur was with them, even if it means not getting his murderer, what else can you expect?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I expect justice!&#x201d; Mrs. Rackell declared, her lips actually moving visibly.<br> &nbsp;<br> I gave it a line to itself in the notebook.<br> &nbsp;<br> Wolfe was frowning at Rackell. &#x201c;There seems to be some confusion. I understood that you want a murder investigated. Now you say you came to me to find out what&#x2019;s going on. If you mean you want me to investigate the police and the FBI, that&#x2019;s too big a bite.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say that,&#x201d; Rackell protested.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, but clear it up. What do you want?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Rackell&#x2019;s down-pointing eyes looked even mournfuller. &#x201c;We want facts,&#x201d; he declared. &#x201c;I think the police and the FBI are quite capable of sacrificing the rights of a private citizen to what they consider the public interest. Our nephew was murdered, and my wife had a right to ask them what line they&#x2019;re proceeding on, and they wouldn&#x2019;t tell her. I don&#x2019;t intend to just let it go at that. Is this a democracy or isn&#x2019;t it? I&#x2019;m not&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No!&#x201d; the wife snapped. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a democracy, it&#x2019;s a republic.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I suggest,&#x201d; said Wolfe, exasperated, &#x201c;that I recapitulate to see if I have it straight. I&#x2019;ll combine what I have read in the papers with what you have told me.&#x201d; He focused on the wife, probably figuring that she would be less apt to cut in if he held her eye. &#x201c;Arthur Rackell, your husband&#x2019;s orphaned nephew, was a fairly efficient employee of his importing business, drawing a good salary, living at your home here in New York, on Sixty-eighth Street. Some three years ago you noted that he was taking a radically leftist position in discussions of political and social questions, and you remonstrated without effect. As time passed he became more leftist and more outspoken, until his opinions and arguments were identical with the Communist line. You, both you and your husband, argued with him and entreated him, but&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I did,&#x201d; Mrs. Rackell snapped. &#x201c;My husband didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Now, Pauline,&#x201d; Rackell protested. &#x201c;I argued with him some.&#x201d; He looked at Wolfe. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t entreat him because I didn&#x2019;t think I had a right to. I don&#x2019;t believe in entreating people about their convictions. I was paying him a salary and I didn&#x2019;t want him to think he had to&#x2014;&#x201d; The importer fluttered a hand. &#x201c;I liked Arthur, and he was my brother&#x2019;s son.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;In any case,&#x201d; Wolfe went on brusquely, still at the wife, &#x201c;he did not change. He stubbornly adhered to the Communist position. He applauded the Communist attack in Korea and denounced the action of the United Nations. You finally found it insufferable and gave him an ultimatum: either he would abandon his outrageous&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not an ultimatum,&#x201d; Mrs. Rackell corrected. &#x201c;My husband refused to permit it. I merely&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Wolfe outspoke her. &#x201c;At least you made it plain that you had had enough and he was no longer welcome in your home. You must have made it fairly strong, since he was moved to disclose an extremely tight secret: that he had been persuaded by the FBI, back in nineteen forty-eight, to join the Communist party for the purpose of espionage. No easy admonition would have dragged that out of him, surely.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say it was easy. I told him&#x2014;&#x201d; She stopped, and the thin lips really did tighten. She relaxed them enough to let words out. &#x201c;I think he thought he would lose his job, and he was well paid. Much more than he earned, the amount of work he did.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Wolfe nodded. &#x201c;Anyhow, he told you his secret, and you promised to keep it, becoming a confederate. Privately admiring him, with others you had to pretend to maintain your condemnation. You told your husband and no one else. That was about a week ago, you say?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And Saturday evening, three days ago, your nephew was murdered. Now to that. You have added little to what the papers have carried, but let&#x2019;s see. He left the apartment, your home, and took a taxi to Chezar&#x2019;s restaurant, where he had a dinner engagement. He had invited three women and two men to dine with him, and they were all there when he arrived, in the bar. When your nephew came they went with him to the table he had reserved and had cocktails. He took a small metal box from&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Gold.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Gold is a metal, madam. He took it from a pocket, his side coat pocket, put it on the table, and left it there while he conferred with the waiter. There was conversation. When plates and rolls and butter were brought, the pillbox got pushed around. It was on the table altogether some ten or twelve minutes. When hors d&#x2019;oeuvres were served, your nephew started to eat, remembered the pillbox, found it behind the basket of rolls, got from it a vitamin capsule, swallowed the capsule with a sip of water, and began on his hors d&#x2019;oeuvres. Six or seven minutes later he suddenly cried out, sprang to his feet, overturning his chair, made convulsive gestures, became rigid, collapsed and crumpled to the floor, and died. A doctor arrived shortly, but he was already dead. It has been found that two other capsules in the metal box, similar in appearance to the one he took, contained what they were supposed to and were harmless; but your nephew had swallowed potassium cyanide. He was murdered by replacing a vitamin capsule with a capsule filled with poison.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Certainly.

Visit him at www.cfpayne.com.In her latest picture book biography, Rappaport capably distills Theodore Roosevelt's life with the help of her trademark primary source quotations interspersed throughout the main text. "Teedie" was a sickly child with a strong intellect and a persistent will. Those latter qualities would serve him well in his adult life, starting with a term in the New York State Assembly and moving on to leadership positions including governor, vice president, and (upon the assassination of William McKinley) president of the United States. Roosevelt had a double standard when it came to other countries interfering in Latin America, but he successfully built the Panama Canal; his domestic agenda included curbing big business and conserving natural resources. Rappaport's account of Roosevelt's political career is balanced with brief but intimate glimpses into his two marriages and family life. As good as Rappaport's text is, however, Payne's illustrations-which seem to straddle the worlds of fine art and political cartoon-are even better, and allow him to capture Roosevelt's multifaceted, larger-than-life personality. On one spread, Payne depicts a fiery Roosevelt lecturing an uninterested legislature; on the next, he shows the man astride his horse in the Dakota Territory with snow falling gently, head bowed in grief at the death of his beloved first wife; and on yet another, he shows the rambunctious Roosevelt clan tearing around the White House. A timeline and bibliography are included. jonathan hunt Horn Book"<br><br>Surely there must be a muse in charge of connecting subject with biographer-that would account for such notable pairings as Isaac Newton with Kathleen Krull (Isaac Newton, BCCB 5/06), or Charles and Emma Darwin with Deborah Heiligman (Charles and Emma, BCCB 2/09). Now Theodore Roosevelt, whose outsized life demands an oversized format, and whose audacious pronouncements demand a biographer willing to let him speak for himself, finds his way into Doreen Rappaport's Big Words series, and the match-making goddess scores again. Roosevelt was arguably the most frenetic of U. S. Presidents, and his renowned energy and multitudinous enthusiasms-both personal and political-are admirably conveyed in the litany of efforts and accomplishments compressed into this fast-moving text. On route to the Big Achievements of TR's life--San Juan Hill, conservation advocacy, and of course the U.S. Presidency-Rappaport can only pause briefly at such career highlights as his civil service shake-up ("Republican lawmakers . . . sighed with relief when Teddy left") and his stint as New York Police Commissioner (again, a new set of "Republican lawmakers . . . sighed with relief when Teddy left"). The very speed at which political appointments and elected offices fly past is a vital characteristic of TR's life, and if readers are left a bit breathless, so much the better. While the overall tone of the narration could be described as amused awe at Roosevelt's expansive and largely realized progressive agenda, his questionable judgment concerning war with Spain over Cuba and his overreach of authority in Panama are addressed as well: "Roosevelt wanted to buy land in Panama to build a canal connecting the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Panama's government refused. . . . I took the Canal Zone and let Congress debate; while the debate goes on, the canal does also.'" Political bluster and bravado are balanced with attention to TR's domestic life, though, and here readers meet a down-to-earth kid to whom they can relate: "He collected animal and bird specimens and created a museum in his room. He smelled. The whole house smelled. All growing boys tend to be grubby; but the ornithological boy is the grubbiest of all.'" It's no wonder TR would grow into the man known for the rambunctiousness of his White House sojourn: "Evenings often ended with pillow fights, wrestling matches, and throwing water balloons off the roof. [Wife] Edith said that Teddy was her seventh child." A strong current of humor also runs through Payne's grittily textured mixed media paintings. There's heroism in the composition of the Rough Riders' charge up San Juan Hill, but it's equally clear that Roosevelt was loving every minute of the battle: "The charge itself was great fun. Oh, but we had a bully fight." An inventive spread wryly suggests a touch of ambivalence as outdoorsman Teddy approaches his marriage among New York gentility with both feet rooted in a Western scene, while his elbow inc BCCB"<br><br>With superb illustrations and a biographical account written by an award-winning author, the story of Theodore Roosevelt comes alive in this beautiful picture book. Teddy grew up as a sickly boy who went on to become the youngest member of the New York State Assembly, New York City Police Commissioner, leader of the Rough Riders, Vice President, and President of the United States. Detailed drawings depict him at the various stages of his life. The descriptions and illustrations lead to a vivid visual image of how a President came to be and about the way he conducted himself during some of the most influential times of his life. Quotes highlighting his views are found throughout. A timeline of important events and selected resources are provided. This unique picture book biography provides an account of a significant man who influenced others throughout his life. Holly Weimar, Associate Professor, Sam Houston State University, Library Science Department, Huntsville, Texas Highly Recommended Library Media Connection"<br><br>U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt certainly dared mighty things, and this lavish picture-book biography deftly captures the legendary man's bold, exuberant nature. Young "Teedie" Roosevelt wanted to be fearless like Daniel Boone and the Valley Forge soldiers he read about, but he was a sickly child. A dramatic full-bleed spread shows the quilt-wrapped Teedie reading in a big chair, visions of polar bears and eagles dancing in his head-an apt reflection of the boy who would go on to keep a giant tortoise in his room at Harvard and then to help protect America's wildlife. Roosevelt's private joys and sorrows as well as professional highlights from his Rough Rider days in Cuba to his 1906 Nobel Peace Prize are chronicled here in colorful, accessible prose, punctuated by character-illuminating quotations. This is a portrait of a passionate man who wanted to make a difference and did, as police commissioner or author, cattle rancher or U.S. president. Payne's expressive, muted paintings-quite grand when showcasing America's majestic landscapes-are full of warmth and humor befitting the joyful man who declared "No man has had a happier life than I have led; a happier life in every way." A truly inspiring tribute to a seemingly larger-than-life U.S. president. (timeline, selected research sources, bibliography, websites, acknowledgments) (Picture book/biography. 7-12) Kirkus"<br><br>Rappaport continues her series of biographies that emphasize direct quotations from their subjects (including Helen's Big World and Abe's Honest Words) by studying the setbacks and successes of Theodore Roosevelt. The author proceeds chronologically, noting Roosevelt's sickliness as a child (as well as his love of animals, which continued through his life), before moving on to his two marriages, service in the New York State Assembly and other public positions, the Rough Riders' taking of San Juan Hill, and his accomplishments as president, after ascending to office following the McKinley assassination. Payne provides hazy, burnished illustrations that alternately reflect Roosevelt's seriousness of purpose (he's shown lassoing a giant fist clutching money as he takes on corporate trusts), playfulness (as in a White House scene crawling with children and pets), and love of nature (Rappaport outlines how Roosevelt helped conserve "230 million acres" of American land). A timeline and suggestions for further reading round out a biography that, despite its brevity, gives a full sense of Roosevelt's life. Ages 6 8. PW"<br><br>Theodore Roosevelt's big ideas and big personality come together in this splendid picture-book biography. Most readers won't know who Roosevelt is, but they will be drawn into the book by the laughing portrait on the otherwise wordless cover. Once inside, they'll be hooked by Rappaport's portrait of young "Teedie," a sickly child, who is nonetheless high-spirited and curious about everything. And he's determined to do as his father insists: make over his body so that it is as strong as his mind. The book's artful design uses two-page spreads to convey Roosevelt's wide-ranging interests and experiences-charging up San Juan Hill; isolating himself in the Dakota territory, after the death of his first wife; even struggling to bust trusts to help small companies compete (here the image is of a small Roosevelt roping a huge hand tightly holding a wad of money). About the only picture that doesn't really work is, ironically, is the dully colored spread that discusses TR's conservation efforts. The text neatly balances brevity and information, and key quotes are in a bold font that draws the eye. Occasionally, events could have been tied together more smoothly, but overall this is a terrific introduction to a one of America's most energetic and far-sighted presidents. - Ilene Cooper Booklist"<br><br>Gr 2-5 Once again, Rappaport offers an accessible introduction to one of the world's most influential people, punctuating her poignant narrative with well-chosen quotes that help frame the life of an important figure. Roosevelt stands tall in American history, but his childhood was one of serious illness that kept him bedridden for long periods of time. He became an avid reader and yearned for the life of the adventurers he read about. "Teedie," as he was called, longed to explore the wilderness and yearned to be a "fearless" man like his heroes. From his early political career through the challenges of his presidency, this book chronicles how he became that fearless leader. He confronted injustice head-on and promised a "Square Deal" to all citizens, opposed many special business interests, including the use of child labor, and sought to protect the nation's wildlife and preserve its beauty. The highs and lows of both his personal and public life are presented here, including the death of his beloved wife, his experience as a soldier with the "Rough Riders," and being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1906. Rappaport breathes life into her subject in a way that is sure to spark the interest of the most reluctant reader. Her choice of quotations defines the man's lively personality and charisma, and Payne's softly shaded artwork highlights his facial expressions and dramatically captures the robust emotion, good humor, and unstinting courage that are the hallmarks of the 26th president. Concisely written and yet poetic, this is a first purchase for every library.

By focusing on a particular group of colonial officials in a specific setting&#x2015;the governors general of French West Africa from 1895 to 1930&#x2015;the author argues that the ideal of a special civilizing mission had a decisive impact on colonial policymaking and on the evolution of modern French republicanism generally. French ideas of civilization&#x2015;simultaneously republican, racist, and modern&#x2015;encouraged the governors general in the 1890&#x2019;s to attack such &#x201c;feudal&#x201d; African institutions as aristocratic rule and slavery in ways that referred back to France&#x2019;s own experience of revolutionary change. Ironically, local administrators in the 1920&#x2019;s also invoked these same ideas to justify such reactionary policies as the reintroduction of forced labor, arguing that coercion, which inculcated a work ethic in the &#x201c;lazy&#x201d; African, legitimized his loss of freedom. By constantly invoking the ideas of &#x201c;civilization,&#x201d; colonial policy makers in Dakar and Paris managed to obscure the fundamental contradictions between &#x201c;the rights of man&#x201d; guaranteed in a republican democracy and the forcible acquisition of an empire that violates those rights. In probing the &#x201c;republican&#x201d; dimension of French colonization in West Africa, this book also sheds new light on the evolution of the Third Republic between 1895 and 1930. One of the author&#x2019;s principal arguments is that the idea of a civilized mission underwent dramatic changes, due to ideological, political, and economic transformations occurring simultaneously in France and its colonies. For example, revolts in West Africa as well as a more conservative climate in the metropole after World War I produced in the governors general a new respect for &#x201c;feudal&#x201d; chiefs, whom the French once despised but now reinstated as a means of control. This discovery of an African &#x201c;tradition&#x201d; in turn reinforced a reassertion of traditional values in France as the Third Republic struggled to recapture the world it had &#x201c;lost&#x201d; at Verdun.</p><p>&#x201c;Conklin brilliantly traces the interconnections and linkages between the three critical sites of political, cultural, and ideological interchange in France&#x2019;s civilizing mission in Africa: the imperial center, the colonial edifice sur place in West Africa, and the Africans themselves. This is scholarship that will eventually provoke a significant change in the way modern French history is conceived, researched, and written.&#x201d; &#x2014;Julia Clancy-Smith,University of ArizonaAlice L.

She&#x2019;d fought with focused determination by Riaz&#x2019;s side, followed his orders on the field without hesitation.<br><br>However, off the field?<br><br>Ice.<br><br>Absolute.<br><br>Unrelenting.<br><br>Glacial enough to bite.<br><br>Folding his arms when she didn&#x2019;t reply, he stepped into her personal space, caught the subtle scent of crushed berries and frost. A strangely delicate scent for this hard-ass of a woman, he thought, before his wolf&#x2019;s anger overrode all else. &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t answered my question.&#x201d; It came out a growl.<br><br>Eyes narrowed, she stepped closer with a slow deliberation that was pure, calculated provocation. She was a tall woman, but he was taller. That didn&#x2019;t seem to stop her from looking down her nose at him. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t realize,&#x201d; she said in a voice so polite it drew blood, &#x201c;that fawning over you was part of the job requirement.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now I know where Indigo learned her mean face from.&#x201d; But where his fellow lieutenant&#x2019;s heart beat warm and generous beneath that tough exterior, he wasn&#x2019;t sure Adria had any emotions that registered above zero on the thermometer.<br><br>Adria&#x2019;s response was scalpel sharp. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what she ever saw in you, but I suppose every woman has mistakes in her past.&#x201d; The slightest change in her expression, the tiniest fracture, before it was sealed up again, her face an impenetrable mask.<br><br>Scowling, Riaz was about to tell her exactly what he thought of her and her judgmental gaze when his cell phone rang. He answered without moving an inch away from the woman who was sandpaper across his temper, rubbing him raw with her mere presence. &#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My office,&#x201d; Hawke said. &#x201c;Need you to head out, do a pickup.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Be there in two.&#x201d; Snapping the phone shut, he closed the remaining distance between him and Adria, forcing her to tip back her head. &#x201c;We will,&#x201d; he said, realizing those striking blue eyes with an edge of purple had streaks of gold running through them, beautiful and exotic, &#x201c;continue this later.&#x201d;<br><br>That was when Adria&#x2019;s cell phone rang. &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; she answered, without breaking eye-contact with the big, muscled wolf who thought he could intimidate her.<br><br>&#x201c;In my office,&#x201d; Hawke ordered.<br><br>&#x201c;On my way.&#x201d; Hanging up, she raised an eyebrow at Riaz in a consciously insolent action. &#x201c;My alpha has requested my presence, so get out of my fucking way,&#x201d; she said with utmost sweetness.<br><br>Eyes of beaten gold narrowed again. &#x201c;Guess we&#x2019;ll be walking together.&#x201d;<br><br>Not giving an inch until he stepped back and turned to head to Hawke&#x2019;s office, she walked in silence beside him, though her wolf bared its teeth, hungry to draw blood, to bite and claw and mark. Damn him. Damn him. She&#x2019;d been doing fine, coping after her final separation from Martin. That had been a bloody battle, too.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll come crawling back to me. Maybe I&#x2019;ll be waiting. Maybe I won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>Adria stifled a raw laugh. Martin didn&#x2019;t understand that it was over. Done. It had been over the night a year ago when he&#x2019;d stormed out of their home, not to return for four months. The truly stunning thing was that he&#x2019;d had the gall to be shocked when she&#x2019;d told him to find someplace else to sleep and slammed the door in his face.<br><br>&#x201c;Cat got your tongue?&#x201d; An acerbic comment made in a deep male voice that ruffled her fur the wrong way.<br><br>&#x201c;Go bite yourself,&#x201d; she muttered, in no mood to play games. Her skin felt too sensitive, as if she&#x2019;d lost a protective layer, her blood too hot.<br><br>&#x201c;Someone should bite you,&#x201d; Riaz responded in a near snarl. &#x201c;Pull that stick out of your ass at the same time.&#x201d;<br><br>Adria growled just as they reached the open door to Hawke&#x2019;s office. The alpha looked up at their entrance, open speculation in blue eyes so pale, they were those of a wolf given human form. However, when he spoke, his words were pragmatic. &#x201c;You two free to go for a drive?&#x201d;<br><br>Adria nodded, saw Riaz do the same beside her. &#x201c;What do you need done?&#x201d; he asked, his tone far calmer than the one he&#x2019;d leveled at her.<br><br>&#x201c;Mack and one of his trainee techs went up to do a routine service of the hydro station,&#x201d; Hawke told them, shoving back strands of hair the silver-gold of his pelt in wolf form, &#x201c;but their vehicle&#x2019;s not starting, and they&#x2019;ve got components that need to be brought back to the den for repairs.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No problem,&#x201d; Riaz said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take one of the SUVs, pick them up.&#x201d;<br><br>Even as Adria was thinking the task was a one-person job, Hawke turned to her. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re now one of the most senior people in the den.&#x201d; His dominance was staggering, demanding her wolf&#x2019;s absolute attention. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like you to get reacquainted with the region, given that you haven&#x2019;t spent an extended period of time here since you turned eighteen.&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll ask Riley and Eli to work some time into my shift schedule.&#x201d; It was a necessary detour from her normal duties&#x2014;falling just below the lieutenants in the hierarchy, senior soldiers were often called upon to lead, and as a leader she had to know every inch of this land, not only the section she&#x2019;d been assigned to during the battle. &#x201c;It&#x2019;d be better if I do it on foot.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d see, scent, so much more.<br><br>&#x201c;You can explore in detail later on. I want you to have a good working knowledge of the area as soon as possible.&#x201d; He handed her a thin plas map. &#x201c;The trip up to the hydro station will take you through some critical sections&#x2014;and you have certification in auto mechanics, correct?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; It had been an interest she&#x2019;d turned into the secondary qualification all soldiers were required to possess. Later, it had kept her sane, the ability to fix broken things and make them whole again. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take a look at the vehicle.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about the replanting?&#x201d; Riaz asked, his voice clawing over her skin like nails on one of those old-fashioned chalkboards the pups liked to draw on. &#x201c;Felix&#x2019;s team have enough security?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re fine.&#x201d; Walking to the territorial map on the stone wall of his office, Hawke tapped the large crosshatched section where the battle with Pure Psy had taken place. &#x201c;Felix&#x2019;s volunteers and conscripts&#x201d;&#x2014;a sharp grin&#x2014;&#x201c;are planting the area with fast-growing natives, but for now, it&#x2019;s so open it&#x2019;s easy to monitor, especially with the cats sharing the watch.&#x201d;<br><br>Adria thought of what she&#x2019;d seen on that battlefield filled with the screams of wounded SnowDancers; the cold amber and red of a flame so hypnotic and deadly, and wondered at the cost paid by the young Psy woman who held all that power&#x2014;and their alpha&#x2019;s heart. &#x201c;What are the chances of another serious Pure Psy attack?&#x201d; she asked, intrigued on the innermost level by a relationship that appeared so very unbalanced on the outside, and yet one that her wolf sensed was as solid as the stone of the den.<br><br>It was Riaz who answered. &#x201c;According to Judd&#x2019;s sources, close to nil. They&#x2019;ve got worse problems.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Civil war,&#x201d; Hawke said, shaking his head. &#x201c;If he&#x2019;s right, all hell is going to break loose&#x2014;so we make sure we&#x2019;re prepared to weather any storms.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The irritation hits?&#x201d; Riaz asked, and Adria knew he was referring to the sporadic attempts to lay booby traps in den territory.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Hawke agreed with a scowl. &#x201c;Scent trails point to the perpetrators being a number of the Pure Psy survivors who just can&#x2019;t let it go. They&#x2019;re disorganized and their traps are laughable. Still, I have all the sentries taking care not to accidentally fall into a hole. A hole for crissakes!&#x201d;<br><br>Adria&#x2019;s wolf nodded in disgusted agreement. It really was time to retreat when you had to resort to digging holes and covering them up with leaves in the hope that SnowDancer&#x2019;s people wouldn&#x2019;t sniff them out a mile away. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll get tired sooner or later, but it might be an idea to make finding these traps a bit of a joke contest between the sentries.&#x201d;<br><br>Riaz angled his head toward her in a very wolfish way, even as Hawke&#x2019;s frustrated expression turned to one of interest.<br><br>&#x201c;From what I&#x2019;ve seen,&#x201d; she said, keeping her eyes resolutely away from the man to her right, &#x201c;the amount of time they have to waste neutralizing the traps is starting to frustrate the soldiers who patrol the borders, and it&#x2019;s the kind of thing that can grow into anger. That&#x2019;s not good for our people, especially coming off the stress of the battle. But if you make it so the sentry with the most sightings gets a prize at the end of each week&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2014;it becomes a game,&#x201d; Riaz completed with a thoughtful nod. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s very good.&#x201d;<br><br>Hands behind her back, Adria squeezed the wrist of one hand with the other to keep from snapping back that she didn&#x2019;t need his endorsement. The response was so far from her usual even-tempered nature that she bit down on the inside of her lip to snap herself out of it, her gaze focused straight ahead. Except the stranger who&#x2019;d taken over her body couldn&#x2019;t simply shut up. &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; Honey sweet. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so glad you approve.&#x201d;<br><br>A growl tangled up the air currents.<br><br>&#x201c;Wolves do like a game,&#x201d; Hawke said, his face suspiciously bland. &#x201c;I think Drew&#x2019;s the best person to organize it&#x2014;I&#x2019;ll get that in motion.&#x201d; He glanced at the time projected on the wall. &#x201c;You two better head out so you can get back before dinner.&#x201d;<br><br>Walking out of the office with the man whose very scent&#x2014;dark, of the forest, with an edgy undertone of citrus and a brush of woodsmoke&#x2014;made her skin itch, she said, &#x201c;We should get some food.&#x201d; The drive wouldn&#x2019;t be quick, plus Mack and his tech hadn&#x2019;t planned to be up there this long and would be hungry.<br><br>&#x201c;Should be something in here,&#x201d; Riaz said, entering the senior soldiers&#x2019; break room.<br><br>They worked with honed efficiency to slap together some sandwiches, and were ready to go ten minutes later. Clenching her abdominal muscles as she got into the vehicle with Riaz, Adria told herself to concentrate on the route, the geography, anything but the potent masculine scent of the man in the driver&#x2019;s seat . . . because she knew full well why he incited such violence in her.<br><br>Riaz drove them out of the garage and into the mountains, very aware of the arctic silence from the passenger seat. The more time he spent with Adria, the more he realized how unlike Indigo she was, in spite of the superficial similarity of their looks. One of the reasons he&#x2019;d always enjoyed the other woman&#x2019;s company was her upfront nature&#x2014;Adria, by comparison, was a closed box, with <i>Do Not Enter</i> signs pasted on every surface.<br><br>He understood that. Hell, he had his own &#x201c;no go&#x201d; zones, but with Adria, it was armor of broken glass that drew blood. &#x201c;This track,&#x201d; he said, doing his job because, personality clash or not, he knew his responsibilities, &#x201c;is the most direct route to the hydro station.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not according to the map Hawke gave me.&#x201d; A quick, penetrating glance. &#x201c;So what&#x2019;s wrong with the other road?&#x201d;<br><br>Reining in his wolf when it bared its teeth at what it read as a challenge, though the rational part of him knew he was just revved up for a fight after her earlier provocation, he said, &#x201c;Sheer cliff face right in the middle.&#x201d; As a lieutenant who&#x2019;d had her under his command on the field, he appreciated her intelligence and determination to learn&#x2014;regardless of how often she used that sharp mind to slice into him with verbal claws.<br><br>Making two tight turns, he continued onward through the mountains that seemed to touch the sky. &#x201c;Meant to delay any aggressors if they ever get that far.&#x201d;<br><br>Adria didn&#x2019;t say anything for several long minutes, studying the map and their passage into the mountains. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll need to request another senior soldier go with me on some of my exploratory trips&#x201d;&#x2014;her naturally husky voice low in thought&#x2014;&#x201c;so I don&#x2019;t miss things like that. I didn&#x2019;t have reason to memorize or even know all this as a teenager, and I&#x2019;m sure security details have been changed in the meantime anyway.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take you,&#x201d; Riaz said, because damn it, he was a lieutenant, even when it came to a prickly piece of cactus like Adria. &#x201c;Indigo made sure I was familiar with the details after I came back from my posting in Europe.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d been away long enough for many of the subtle security precautions to have been altered. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be good for me to review the knowledge.&#x201d;<br><br>Adria blinked, fingertips tightening on the sides of the plas map. &#x201c;I appreciate it.&#x201d; It was the only thing she could say without giving everything away.<br><br>Riaz snorted, his hands strong and competent on the manual steering wheel as he navigated a particularly steep embankment, his bronzed arms dusted with a sprinkling of fine black hair. &#x201c;About as much as you appreciate a root canal,&#x201d; he said, thrusting the vehicle into hover drive, &#x201c;but whatever your problem with me, we have to work together.&#x201d;<br><br>Setting her jaw, she focused on the view beyond the window&#x2014;of the most magnificent scenery on this earth. Summer had faded, fall a crisp promise in the air, but here the land was swathed in dark green, the peaks in the distance touched with white. She&#x2019;d grown up on this land, and even now, after she&#x2019;d been away for so long, it sang to her wolf, as it did to every SnowDancer. Den territory had a way of being home to all of them, no matter if they&#x2019;d given the name to another place.<br><br><i>I can heal here</i>.<br><br>It was a thought deep in her heart, one that almost managed to unknot the tension wi&#x2014; &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; She jerked forward as a big tan-colored wolf raced across a verdant meadow to their left, chasing a sleek silver wolf she immediately recognized. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s being rough with Evie.&#x201d; Fury boiled in her blood. &#x201c;Stop the car.&#x201d;<br><br>Riaz&#x2019;s chuckle held pure male amusement, fuel to her temper. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Tai, and Evie won&#x2019;t appreciate the interruption, Aunt Adria.&#x201d;<br><br>Biting back her harsh response, Adria glanced at the two wolves again, saw what she&#x2019;d missed at first glance. They were playing, all teeth and claws, but with no real aggression to it. Just as Riaz turned a corner, cutting off the view, the two wolves nuzzled one another and Adria realized Tai and Evie weren&#x2019;t playing, they were courting.<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s too young.&#x201d; While Indigo was very close to Adria in age, Tarah had borne Evie later in life. The little girl had toddled around after her older sister and Adria when they&#x2019;d been in their teens, sweet natured and stubborn and beloved. Adria couldn&#x2019;t imagine her submissive niece was in any way ready to handle a dominant&#x2014;and having met Tai, she knew he was a hell of a lot stronger and more dangerous than Evie.<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s still a wolf,&#x201d; Riaz said, his deep voice a rumble that vibrated uncomfortably against her achingly tight nipples, &#x201c;an adult female wolf. You might have forgotten, Ms. Frost, but touch is necessary for most of our kind.&#x201d;<br><br>Her hand fisted, that nerve far too close to the surface.<br><br><i>A year</i>.<br><br>It had been a year since she&#x2019;d shared intimate skin privileges, a rawly painful kind of isolation for a predatory changeling in the prime of her life. Even before then, things had been fragmenting for a long time, her wolf starved of affection. But she&#x2019;d ...</p><h2>Lose Weight by Eating: 130 Amazing Clean-Eating Makeovers for Guilt-Free Comfort Food (Lose Weight By Eating, 4)</h2><p><p>Lose weight by eating guilt-free, low-calorie, unprocessed versions of all your favorite foods, with this helpful, accessible diet and cookbook&#x2014;featuring more than 130 clean eating recipes and gorgeous full-color photos&#x2014;from the popular weight loss blogger who lost 150 pounds in eleven months.</p><p>At 275 pounds, Audrey Johns was unhealthy and unhappy&#x2014;until the day she vowed to give up the &#x201c;fake food&#x201d; and taught herself to cook her favorites from scratch.

She always dreams big.The Danger of Desire One<p></p> <br>London<br> <br>August 1830<br> <br>When Warren Corry, Marquess of Knightford, arrived at a Venetian breakfast thrown by the Duke and Duchess of Lyons, he regretted having stayed out until the wee hours of the morning. Last night he&#x2019;d been so glad to be back among the distractions of town that he&#x2019;d drunk enough brandy to pickle a barrel of herrings.<br> <br>Bad idea, since the duke and duchess had decided to hold the damned party in the blazing sun on the lawn of their lavish London mansion. His mouth was dry, his stomach churned, and his head felt like a stampeding herd of elephants.<br> <br>His best friend, Edwin, had better be grateful that Warren kept his promises.<br> <br>&#x201c;Warren!&#x201d; cried a female voice painfully close. &#x201c;What are you doing here?&#x201d;<br> <br>It was Clarissa, his cousin, who was also Edwin&#x2019;s wife&#x2014;and the reason Warren had dragged himself from bed at the ungodly hour of noon.<br> <br>He shaded his eyes to peer at her. As usual, she had the look of a delicate fairy creature. But he knew better than to fall for that cat-in-the-cream smile. &#x201c;Must you shout like that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not shouting.&#x201d; She cocked her head. &#x201c;And you look ill. So you must have had a grand time at St. George&#x2019;s Club last night. Either that, or in the stews early this morning.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I always have a grand time.&#x201d; Or at least he kept the night at bay, which was the purpose of staying out until all hours.<br> <br>&#x201c;Which is precisely why it&#x2019;s unlike you to be here. Especially when Edwin isn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; She narrowed her eyes on him. &#x201c;Wait a minute&#x2014;Edwin sent you, didn&#x2019;t he? Because he couldn&#x2019;t be in town for it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What? No.&#x201d; He bent to kiss her cheek. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t a fellow come to a breakfast to see his favorite cousin?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He can. But he generally doesn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>Warren snagged a glass of champagne off a passing tray. &#x201c;Well, he did today. Wait, who are we talking about, again?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Very amusing.&#x201d; Taking the glass from him, she frowned. &#x201c;You do not need this. You&#x2019;re clearly cropsick.&#x201d;<br> <br>He snatched it back and downed it. &#x201c;Which is precisely why I require some hair of the dog.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re avoiding the subject. Did Edwin send you here to spy on me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be absurd. He merely wanted me to make sure you&#x2019;re all right. You know your husband&#x2014;he hates having to be at the estate with your brother while you&#x2019;re in town.&#x201d; He glanced at her thickening waist. &#x201c;Especially when you&#x2019;re . . . well . . . like that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, Lord, not you, too. Bad enough to have him and Niall hovering over me all the time, worried about my getting hurt somehow, but if he&#x2019;s sent you to start doing that&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, I swear. He only asked that I come by if I were invited to this. I had to be in town anyway, so I figured why not pop in to Lyons&#x2019;s affair?&#x201d; He waved his empty glass. &#x201c;The duke always orders excellent champagne. But now that I&#x2019;ve had some, I&#x2019;ll be on my way.&#x201d;<br> <br>She took him by the arm. &#x201c;No, indeed. I so rarely get to see you anymore. Stay awhile. They&#x2019;re about to start the dancing.&#x201d;<br> <br>Uh-oh. Clarissa had been trying to find him a wife for years, and lately both she and Edwin&#x2019;s sister, Yvette Keane, had doubled their efforts. Probably because they were both now happily married and thought it just the thing for a bachelor.<br> <br>He was in no mood for such machinations today. &#x201c;Why would I dance with a lot of simpering misses who think a marquess the ideal prize? I&#x2019;m too cropsick to deflect veiled questions about what I&#x2019;m looking for in a wife.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her frown revealed her intentions as fully as if she&#x2019;d spoken them. &#x201c;Fine. Be an old grump, if you must. But you could dance with me. I can still dance, you know.&#x201d;<br> <br>No doubt. Except for during her disastrous debut, Clarissa had always been a lively sort, who wouldn&#x2019;t be slowed by something as inconsequential as bearing the heir to the reserved and eccentric Earl of Blakeborough.<br> <br>Clarissa and Edwin were so different that Warren occasionally wondered what the two of them saw in each other. But whenever he witnessed their obvious affection, he realized there must be something deeper than personalities cementing their marriage. It made him envious.<br> <br>He scowled. That was absurd. He didn&#x2019;t intend to marry for a very long while. At least not until he was much older. Even then, he would prefer a lusty widow who could endure his . . . idiosyncrasies. Certainly not some coy chit eager to use him as a ladder for climbing the ranks of high society.<br> <br>Or worse yet, a sanctimonious female like his mother, chiding him for every attempt he made to enjoy himself. To forget.<br> <br>Clarissa stared off into the crowd. &#x201c;As long as you&#x2019;re here, I . . . um . . . do need a favor.&#x201d;<br> <br>Damn. &#x201c;What kind of favor?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Edwin would do it if he didn&#x2019;t have to be in Hertfordshire helping my brother settle the family estate, you know,&#x201d; she babbled. &#x201c;And Niall&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the favor?&#x201d; he persisted.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you know Miss Delia Trevor?&#x201d;<br> <br>Miss Delia Trevor? God, would Clarissa never stop trying to match him up? &#x201c;Fortunately, I do not. I assume she&#x2019;s some young debutante you&#x2019;ve taken under your wing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not exactly. Although Delia was just brought out this past Season, she&#x2019;s nearly my age . . . and a friend. Her brother died last year in a horrible accident, and she and his wife, Brilliana Trevor, have been left without anything but a debt-ridden estate to support. So Delia&#x2019;s aunt, Lady Pensworth, brought the two of them to London for the Season.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Agatha Pensworth, wife of the late Baron Pensworth? The woman who used to be great friends with my mother?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s her. I suppose you&#x2019;ve met?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Years ago, before Mother died. As I recall, she rarely minced words.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She doesn&#x2019;t suffer fools easily. And she has a fondness for her niece, which is why they&#x2019;re all in town.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So her ladyship can find husbands for the two young ladies.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, although I think Lady Pensworth is more concerned about Delia, since the late Mr. Trevor&#x2019;s wife has already borne him a child who will inherit the estate, such as it is. To make Delia more eligible, Lady Pensworth has bestowed a thousand-pound dowry on her, which ought to tempt some eligible gentlemen.&#x201d;<br> <br>That put him on his guard. &#x201c;Not me.&#x201d;<br> <br>She rolled her eyes. &#x201c;Of course not you. Things do not always concern you, for heaven&#x2019;s sake. She needs someone decidedly younger. She&#x2019;s only twenty-three, after all.&#x201d;<br> <br>Decidedly younger? &#x201c;Here now, I&#x2019;m not that old. I&#x2019;m the same age as your husband.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;True.&#x201d; Her eyes twinkled at him. &#x201c;And given your nightly habits, you apparently possess the stamina of a much younger man. No one seeing you in dim light would ever guess you&#x2019;re thirty-three.&#x201d;<br> <br>He eyed her askance. &#x201c;I seem to recall your asking me for a favor, dear girl. You&#x2019;re not going about getting it very wisely.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The thing is, I&#x2019;m worried about Delia, who seems rather distracted these days. She keeps receiving notes that she slips furtively off to read, and she falls asleep in the middle of balls. Worst of all, she says she can&#x2019;t attend our house party, which I&#x2019;d partly planned in hopes of introducing her to eligible gentlemen.&#x201d; She cast him a pointed look. &#x201c;Eligible young gentlemen.&#x201d;<br> <br>Thirty-three wasn&#x2019;t old, no matter what his sharp-tongued cousin thought. &#x201c;Perhaps your friend had another engagement.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clarissa lifted an eyebrow at him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Right. She needs a husband, and you&#x2019;re nicely trying to provide her with a selection of potential ones.&#x201d; He smirked at her. &#x201c;How ungrateful of her not to fall in with your plans.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do be serious. When was the last time you saw any unmarried woman with limited prospects refuse a chance to attend a house party at the home of an earl and a countess with our connections?&#x201d;<br> <br>He hated to admit it, but she had a point. &#x201c;So what do you want me to do about it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ask around at St. George&#x2019;s. See if the gentlemen have heard any gossip about her. Find out if anyone knows some scoundrel who&#x2019;s been . . . well . . . sniffing around her for her dowry.&#x201d;<br> <br>The light dawned. Perhaps this really wasn&#x2019;t about matching him up with her friend.<br> <br>During her debut years ago, Clarissa had been the object of a scoundrel&#x2019;s attentions, and it had nearly destroyed the lives of her and her brother. So she tended to be sensitive about women who might fall prey to fortune hunters.<br> <br>Indeed, having learned this summer what she&#x2019;d gone through&#x2014;and before that, what Edwin&#x2019;s sister had gone through to a lesser extent&#x2014;he&#x2019;d become far more aware of how easily men preyed on even the most respectable women. That was why Edwin had begun St. George&#x2019;s and Warren had joined&#x2014;to make sure that men who cared about the women in their lives could look out for them more effectively in a society where fortune hunters and scoundrels abounded.<br> <br>But it was still problematic for him to do what Clarissa asked. &#x201c;You realize that if I start asking at the club about an eligible young lady&#x2019;s situation, our members will assume I&#x2019;m interested in courting her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nonsense. Everyone knows you prefer soiled doves to society loves.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I like society women perfectly well . . . as long as they have inattentive or dead husbands. It makes matters infinitely less complicated.&#x201d; And there were plenty of those women about, which was one reason he wasn&#x2019;t keen to marry. He had a ready supply of bedmates without having to leg-shackle himself.<br> <br>&#x201c;My point is,&#x201d; she said testily, &#x201c;everyone knows your preferences. And asking questions is the purpose of St. George&#x2019;s, is it not? To provide a place where gentlemen can determine the character of various suitors?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For their female relations,&#x201d; he said tersely. &#x201c;Not for the friends of their female relations.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clarissa stared up at him. &#x201c;She has no man to protect her. And I very much fear all the signs lead to her having found someone unsuitable, which is why she&#x2019;s behaving oddly. I don&#x2019;t want to see her end up trapped in a disastrous marriage. Or worse.&#x201d;<br> <br>They both knew what the &#x201c;worse&#x201d; was, since Clarissa had gone through it herself. Damn. He might not have been Clarissa&#x2019;s guardian for some time, but she still knew how to tug at his conscience. And it gnawed at him that he&#x2019;d been unaware of what had been done to her before he&#x2019;d become her guardian, that it had taken his best friend&#x2019;s perception to parse it out.<br> <br>&#x201c;It would be a very great favor to me,&#x201d; Clarissa went on. &#x201c;I tell you what&#x2014;she&#x2019;s here, so let me introduce you. You can spend a few moments talking to her and see if I&#x2019;m right to be alarmed. If you think I&#x2019;m overly concerned, you may leave here with my blessing and never bother with it again. But if you think I might be right . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine. But you owe me for this. And I promise I will call in my debt down the road.&#x201d; He forced a smile. &#x201c;At the very least, you must introduce me to some buxom widow with loose morals and an eye for fun.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hmm,&#x201d; she said, rolling her eyes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to speak to my brother-in-law about that. He has more connections among that sort than I do.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No doubt.&#x201d; Her brother-in-law used to use a number of &#x201c;that sort&#x201d; as models in his paintings. &#x201c;But I can talk to Keane without your help. So I suppose I&#x2019;ll settle for your promise not to be offended if I refuse your invitation to your house party.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There was a possibility of your accepting? Shocking. Still, I did hope&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So where is this woman you wish me to meet?&#x201d;<br> <br>Clarissa sighed. &#x201c;Last time I saw her she was right over there by the fountain.&#x201d; As she turned that direction she stiffened. &#x201c;What on earth are those fellows doing with Delia?&#x201d;<br> <br>She stalked across the lawn and he followed, surveying the group she headed for: a woman surrounded by three young gentlemen who appeared to be fishing&#x2014;fishing?&#x2014;in the fountain.<br> <br>He recognized the men. One was a drunk, one a well-known rakehell, and the third a notorious gambler by the name of Pitford. All three were fortune hunters.<br> <br>No wonder Clarissa was worried about her friend.<br> <br>He turned his attention to the chit, who had her back to him and was dressed in a blue-and-green plaid gown with a pink-and-yellow striped shawl and a multi-feathered coiffure that added at least a foot to her height.<br> <br>For the first time, he wished their new king hadn&#x2019;t recently lifted the requirement for the populace to wear mourning for the late George IV. Even the dullness of black and gray gowns as far as the eye could see would be preferable to that nightmare of colors.<br> <br>What&#x2019;s more, any woman who dressed that way was bound to be a heedless twit. He sighed. She would be a nuisance at best, a dead bore at worst. There was nothing he disliked more than a cork-brained female, unless she was sitting on his lap in a brothel, in which case intelligence hardly mattered.<br> <br>As they approached, Clarissa asked, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on here?&#x201d;<br> <br>The jovial chap with cheeks already reddened from too much champagne said, &#x201c;The clasp broke on Miss Trevor&#x2019;s bracelet and it dropped into the fountain, so we&#x2019;re trying to get it out to keep her from ruining her sleeves.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d prefer to ruin my entire gown than see you further damage my bracelet with your poking about,&#x201d; the chit said, her voice surprisingly low and throaty. &#x201c;If you gentlemen would just let me pass, I&#x2019;d fish it out myself.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nonsense, we can do it,&#x201d; the other two said as they fought over the stick wielded by the drunk. In the process, they managed to jab Miss Trevor in the arm.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ow!&#x201d; She attempted to snatch the stick. &#x201c;For pity&#x2019;s sake, gentlemen . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Warren had seen enough. &#x201c;Stand aside, lads.&#x201d; He pushed through the arses. Shoving his coat sleeve up as far as it would go, he thrust his hand into the fountain and grabbed the bracelet. Then he turned to offer it to the young lady. &#x201c;I assume this is yours, miss.&#x201d;<br> <br>When her startled gaze shot to him, he froze. She had the loveliest blue eyes he&#x2019;d ever seen.<br> <br>Though her gown was even more outrageous from the front, the rest of her was unremarkable. Tall and slender, with no breasts to speak of, she had decent skin, a sharp nose, and a rather impudent-looking mouth. She was a pretty enough brunette, but by no means a beauty. And not his sort. At all.<br> <br>Yet those eyes . . .<br> <br>Fringed with long black lashes, they glittered like stars against an early-evening sky, making desire tighten low in his belly. Utterly absurd.<br> <br>Until her lips curved into a sparkling smile that matched the incandescence of her eyes. &#x201c;Thank you, sir. The bracelet was a gift from my late brother. Though I fear you may have ruined your shirt retrieving it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nonsense.&#x201d; He held out the bracelet. &#x201c;My valet is very good at his job.&#x201d;<br> <br>As she took the jewelry from him, an odd expression crossed her face. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re left-handed.&#x201d;<br> <br>He arched one brow. &#x201c;How clever of you to notice.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How clever of you to be so. And it&#x2019;s hard not to notice, since I&#x2019;m left-handed, too. There aren&#x2019;t that many of us around.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Or none that will lay claim to the affliction, anyway.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d never before met a lady who would.<br> <br>&#x201c;True.&#x201d; She slipped the bracelet into her reticule with a twinkle in her eye. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always heard it&#x2019;s gauche to be left-handed.&#x201d;<br> <br>Well, well, she was definitely not a twit, if she knew that gauche was the French word for left. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always heard it&#x2019;s a sign of subservience to the devil.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That, too. Though the last time I paid a visit to Lucif...</p><h2>The Changing Face of World Missions: Engaging Contemporary Issues and Trends (Encountering Mission)</h2><p>The dramatic changes that have taken place both in global society and in the church have implications for how the church does missions in the twenty-first century.

They are fixin&#x2019; to make trouble for you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Milt turned around and looked at the big, clumsy man, his shirt stuffed into his trousers and held there by a rope belt. Thacker never seemed to have a full beard and always seemed to need a shave. His watery blue eyes looked vague. He rolled his quid in his jaws and spat.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m tellin&#x2019; you, son. You done me a favor or two.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why should they be after me?&#x201d; Cogar demanded. He was a lean young man with a dark, leatherlike face. His eyes were almost black, and keen.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Spencer wants your horses. You know that. He sets a sight of store by good horseflesh, and he&#x2019;s had a thorn in his side ever since you rode into the valley. Anyway, you&#x2019;re a stranger, and this country don&#x2019;t cotton to strangers.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Milt Cogar hitched his gun belts and stared at Thacker. &#x201c;Thanks. I&#x2019;ll not forget it. But betwixt the two of us, this country has reason to be afraid of strangers.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Thacker&#x2019;s eyes shifted uneasily. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you be sayin&#x2019; that aloud. Not around here. And don&#x2019;t you tell nobody what I said.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Thacker drifted off down toward his shack, and Milt Cogar stood there, uncertainly. He was not ready to drift, nor did he like being pushed, but he had sensed the undercurrent of feeling against him.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mesquite was a rustler town. It was a holdup man&#x2019;s town, and he was a wild horse wrangler and a drifter. He threw the saddle on the paint and cinched it down. All the while he was thinking of Jennie Lewis, for she was the reason he had stayed on at Mesquite.<br> &nbsp;<br> Milt Cogar was no trouble-hunting man. He knew that of himself and he told that to himself once more. In nearly thirty years of drifting, he had kept clear of most of the trouble that came his way. Not that he hadn&#x2019;t had his share, for times came when a man couldn&#x2019;t dodge fights. This could be that kind of time.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dan Spencer was ramrodding the town. He was the big wheel. Milt had seen the big man&#x2019;s eyes trailing him down the dusty corner of road that did duty as Mesquite&#x2019;s main street. There were only four buildings on that street, and a dozen houses. Jennie lived in the house back under the cottonwoods with Joe and Mom Peters.<br> &nbsp;<br> Spencer wasn&#x2019;t only big and rough. He was slick. He was slicker than blue mud on a side hill, only he didn&#x2019;t look it. Milt was a top hand at reading sign, and he could read the tracks years left across a man&#x2019;s face. He knew what manner of a man Dan Spencer was, and what to expect from the others, from Record and Martinez.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a mean little place, this valley. The scattering of ugly, unpainted frame buildings, the hillsides covered with scrub pine and juniper, the trail a dusty pathway through the pine and huge, flat-faced boulders. There was a waterhole, and it was that which had started the town. And somewhere back in the cliff and brush country there was a canyon where Spencer and his boys backed up their stolen cattle.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thacker was right. He should throw a leg over his horse right now and light a shuck out of here. If he stayed, there would be trouble, and he was no gunfighter like Spencer or Record, nor a knife-in-the-belly killer like Martinez. He should light out of here right now, but there was Jennie Lewis.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jennie was eighteen now, a slim, lovely girl with soft gray eyes and ash-blond hair. She looked like the wind could blow her away but there was quick, bubbling laughter in her, and sometimes a look in her eyes that touched something away down inside of a man.<br> &nbsp;<br> She was a casualty of the trail. Cholera had wiped out her family, and Joe Peters had found her, ten years old and frightened, and carried her home. Only now she was big enough and old enough for Spencer to see, and what Dan Spencer wanted, he took.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nobody in town would stop Spencer. There were twenty-seven people in Mesquite, but those who weren&#x2019;t outlaws were shy, frightened people who made themselves obscure and came and went as silently as possible, fearful of speaking lest Dan Spencer lay eyes upon them.<br> &nbsp;<br> THAT WAS HOW it had been until Milt Cogar rode into town with his catch of wild horses, sixteen head of them, and all fine stock, and most of them broke to ride. Milt was going on through, but he stopped by the waterhole with his horses, and while they drank he talked with Jennie.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve beautiful horses,&#x201d; she said wistfully. &#x201c;I never saw anything so beautiful, not even the horses that Spencer has.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They are nice.&#x201d; Cogar was a man unused to the sound of his voice, for he lived much alone. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s one of the reasons why I catch them. I like working with horses.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She was standing near one of them, and the black put out a friendly nose, and she touched it. The horse did not shy.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You would never guess they had ever been wild,&#x201d; she said wonderingly. &#x201c;They are so gentle.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Most horses are nice folks, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They like people. You teach one he doesn&#x2019;t have to be afraid, and right away he gets mighty curious and friendly. For the first few days you just keep them around, no sudden movements, no violence. Just keep a firm hand on them, and feed them well.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Horses when frightened can&#x2019;t think, not even so much as people, but once they know a man, they&#x2019;ll trust him to take them anywhere at all.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She looked at him thoughtfully. &#x201c;You must be a kind man,&#x201d; she said gently. &#x201c;Most men around here break their horses rough.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He flushed and looked away, feeling the slow red on his face and neck and hating himself for being self-conscious. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know about that, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Hurriedly, he tried to change the subject. &#x201c;Your folks live here?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A shadow touched her face. &#x201c;No, they are dead, long ago. I live with Joe Peters over on the sidehill. He and Mom took me in when I was a child.&#x201d; Her eyes went to his. &#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t staying here?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I was figuring on drifting through,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;down toward the canyon country. I got me a little place down there, and I figured to rest up for a while.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It must be nice to go wherever you want,&#x201d; she said slowly, shifting the heavy wooden bucket in her hands. &#x201c;This is an awful place!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The sudden feeling in her voice shocked him. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you leave?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t. Dan Spencer wouldn&#x2019;t let me, not even if I found a way to get out.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Spencer? What&#x2019;s he to you?&#x201d; Milt Cogar pushed his black hat back on his head and looked at her, seeing the softness in her eyes, and the worry, too. Yet it was more than worry: it was fear.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He runs Mesquite and everybody in it. He...wants me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Do you want him? You aim to marry him?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She flushed anew. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve not much to say about it here. If he wants me, there&#x2019;s nobody to stop him. As for the rest of it, he hasn&#x2019;t said anything about marrying.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Milt Cogar felt chill anger rising within him. &#x201c;Who does this Spencer think he is?&#x201d; he demanded. &#x201c;Nobody can take a girl unless she wants to go! This country&#x2019;s free!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not in Mesquite, it isn&#x2019;t! This is Dan Spencer&#x2019;s town, and nothing happens in it he don&#x2019;t like. You&#x2019;d better keep him from seeing your horses, too. He&#x2019;ll want them.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll trip himself up gettin&#x2019; them!&#x201d; Cogar said decisively. His eyes went to Jennie&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am, why don&#x2019;t you mount up and ride out of here? If you want to go, I&#x2019;ll see you get safe to the Ferry. Once across the river, you can head down toward Prescott or somewhere you&#x2019;d be safe.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, if I only could&#x2014;&#x201d; Her voice died, and Milt looked up.<br> &nbsp;<br> A burly, heavy-shouldered man with two guns was standing across the waterhole.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If you could what?&#x201d; the burly man asked. Then his eyes shifted to Milt, and from him to his horses, which he studied with a slow, appraising look, then back to Cogar. &#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Milt looked at him with careful eyes. There was danger in this man, but he had faced danger before.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a man ridin&#x2019; through,&#x201d; Milt said. &#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Spencer stiffened. &#x201c;Dan Spencer&#x2019;s the name, and I run this town.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Milt lifted his eyes insultingly toward the collection of miserable shacks. &#x201c;Must keep you busy,&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not too busy but what I could teach you some manners!&#x201d; Spencer&#x2019;s voice rang harshly. He walked around the waterhole, hands swinging at his sides. &#x201c;Jennie, you go on home!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Only an instant did the girl hesitate, apprehension for Cogar in her eyes. Then she began backing away.<br> &nbsp;<br> Spencer stopped, a dozen feet from Milt, and dropped his hand to his gun butt&#x2014;then the hand froze where it was, and Dan Spencer&#x2019;s eyes bulged. He was looking into the muzzle of a .44 Winchester carbine. &#x201c;Unbuckle your belt, and be careful!&#x201d; Milt warned.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dan Spencer&#x2019;s face was gray. Very slowly he moved his fingers to the belt and unbuckled it, letting the Colts fall. &#x201c;Now take a step toward me,&#x201d; Cogar commanded.<br> &nbsp;<br> The big man complied. Color was coming back into his face and with it the realization that Milt Cogar had shown him up in front of the girl. Yet there was little he could do. His guns were on the ground behind him now.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Fail: Finding Hope and Grace in the Midst of Ministry Failure</h2><p><ul><li>2014 Best Books About the Church from Byron Borger, Hearts and Minds Bookstore</li></ul> "I thought God had called me to plant this church. Why did we have to shut our doors after only three years?" "I was at my breaking point. Then I got the news that our nine-year-old daughter had leukemia. I would have quit ministry forever, but I had no other employable skills." "False accusations were made against me and my family, wrecking our reputation permanently and forcing us to leave not only the church, but move out of the area." "I've served my church for the past 27 years and I've grown that church from 150 to 24 people." What do we do when we've failed? Some ministries are shipwrecked by moral failures like affairs or embezzlement. But for most of us, the sense of failure is more ordinary: disillusionment, inadequacy, declining budgets, poor decisions, opposition, depression, burnout. Many pastors are deeply broken and wounded, and we come to doubt that God has any use for us. J.R. Briggs, founder of the Epic Fail Pastors Conference, knows what failure feels like. He has listened to pastors who were busted in a prostitution sting or found themselves homeless when ejected from ministry. With candid vulnerability, Briggs explores the landscape of failure, how it devastates us and how it transforms us. Without offering pat answers or quick fixes, he challenges our cultural expectations of success and gives us permission to grieve our losses. Somehow, in the midst of our pain, we are better positioned to receive the grace of healing and restoration.</p><p>"Here is a theology of failure to go with Jesus' sacrament of failure ('shake the dust off your feet and move on'). Find out why the best fail the most, and how the 'great cloud of witnesses' in Hebrews 11 is a cumulonimbus cloud haloing a rogues' gallery. Briggs's solution to a failure of nerve&#x2015;the nerve of failure&#x2015;deserves wide reading." (Leonard Sweet, bestselling author; professor, Drew University, George Fox University; chief contributor to sermons.com)<br><br>"Fear of failure is a power that holds many church leaders in a death grip. In this important book, J.R. Briggs boldly speaks from his own experience and that of others, reminding us that failure is inevitable, but the crucial question is how we find grace and eventually recovery in the aftermath of failure. The gospel that we encounter in <em>Fail</em> is undoubtedly good news, true liberation for our fearful, weary and broken selves. May we heed its call!" (C. Christopher Smith, coauthor, Slow Church, and founding editor of The Englewood Review of Books)<br><br>"In <em>Fail</em> J.R. Briggs succeeds in shining a light on an often taboo subject in modern-day ministry. Through the lens of the gospel, Briggs provides a vision to see failure as an invitation to grow in the grace and knowledge of God. If you are a minister, a former pastor, a fallen pastor or a struggling believer, <em>Fail</em> will encourage, strengthen and instruct you in the freedom offered at the cross. For 'by his wounds, we are healed.'" (Ed Stetzer, author, Subversive Kingdom)<br><br>"J.R. Briggs has something to say to pastors about our American obsession with 'success.' He holds to the Jesus-endorsed notion that those in ministry are called to faithfulness, not success, and that sometimes faithfulness takes the peculiar form of failure. <em>Fail</em> dares to tell the truth and will bring much-needed clarity and comfort to a multitude of ministers who, though faithful, have drunk from the bitter cup of failure." (Brian Zahnd, pastor, Word of Life Church, St. Joseph, Missouri; author, A Farewell To Mars)<br><br>"Someone needed to write a book that would cast vision for the transformational possibilities contained within experiences of failure. J.R. Briggs has done just that! In a voice that is honest, winsome and hopeful, he offers hard-won wisdom for leaning into God's gracious purposes even in the most painful experiences leaders face. Thanks be to God!" (Ruth Haley Barton, founder of the Transforming Center and author of Strengthening the Soul of Your Leadership)<br><br>"J.R. Briggs offers a sobering look at the pain, loneliness and shame we pastors regularly face. Like the apostle Paul, he understands that the best ministry happens when we allow it to flow through our own weakness and failure. Reading this book was like 'a kiss from God on my bruises.'" (Aaron Graham, lead pastor, The District Church, Washington D.C.)<br><br>"J.R. Briggs goes beyond giving us a robust theology of failure; he opens his veins and shares his life. He calls us to be faithful not efficient, to live vulnerably without shame. He gives us grace-filled opportunities to be our true selves. If you are a pastor, you need this book!" (JR Woodward, national director of church planting for V3, author of Creating a Missional Culture)<br><br>"<em>Fail</em> is like a barn for a tired, overburdened mule. That mule is us: preachers, pastors, leaders in the church. The wonderful gift we are given here is a re-yoking, where we come into that barn and have our yokes removed&#x2015;which are of impossible weight to carry and manage&#x2015;and slip into the yoke of Jesus, who carries all the burden of ministry and lets us join him, side by side, on the journey." (Lance Ford, author of UnLeader and coauthor of The Missional Quest)<br><br>"If you are struggling in ministry, this book will be like sitting down with a good friend who knows and understands what you are enduring. No quick fixes. No pat answers. No formulas. No judgment. Just gentle wisdom laced with grace to help you continue in God's calling." (Ruth Graham, author of In Every Pew Sits a Broken Heart)<br><br>"J.R. Briggs captures the struggle of pastors in his new book <em>Fail</em>. The fear of failure is enough to freeze us in our path to ministry. J.R. not only shows the facts as to how this is affecting ministers across every denomination but also points toward solutions for pastors to find their way out in the midst of failure. Pastors often find themselves incapable, inadequate and even incompetent in the task that God has placed before them. J.R. reminds them that the only hope they have to complete the mission God has placed on their calling is to rely on the Holy Spirit." (Maurice Graham, executive director, Shepherd's Staff Ministry, Inc.)<br><br>"With <em>Fail</em>, J.R. Briggs has captured a truth we all crave but fear to articulate. There is not merely grace for the burning- or burnt-out, there is the very life of Christ: full of honesty, meaning and sharp joy. Beyond platitudes or Twitter-quote pep talks, J.R. offers peace, real encouragement, and a better definition of success for Christian ministry. This is the next best thing to sharing the body and blood with people who understand. Failures large and small, visible and invisible, will stand up and shout for J.R.'s wisdom, wit and honesty. I know that I do." (Paul Pastor, associate editor of Christianity Today's Leadership Journal and PARSE)<br><br>"God is allowing thousands of men and women to fail. Isn't that wonderful? It is if you can see it from God's perspective. I believe that God, although hurting with you through your pain and loss, is also delighted in your failure. Why? Because he wants so much more for you! J.R. Briggs will give you language for what you're going through, help you find healing where you are and provide you with some handles for the journey ahead. As a man who has experienced his share of failure, I am so glad someone finally had the courage <em>and</em> hopefulness to write a book like this one. You'll be glad, too!" (Kevin Col�n, neighborhood lead pastor at LifeBridge Christian Church, missional-incarnational coach consultant at Missio)<br><br>"This book is CPR. <em>Fail</em> has given me breath for years to come. Within, Briggs offers an engaging, appealing and learned description of the <em>failed</em> life, invoking his readers to see afresh the breathtaking journey of all the landmarks along the way. Briggs reminds us that half of resurrection is death. And that, to truly live, we <em>must</em> fail. Jesus breathed his Spirit over a group of failed disciples from his cross. That same kind of thing seems to be going on in this book." (A. J. Swoboda, PhD, professor, pastor and author of Messy)J.R.

He also serves as the Director of Leadership Congregational Formation with The Ecclesia Network.

It remains a vast business - if all the cotton bales produced in 2013 had been stacked on top of each other they would have made a somewhat unstable tower 40,000 miles high. </p><p>Sven Beckert's superb new book is a history of the overwhelming role played by cotton in dictating the shape of our world. It is both a gripping narrative and a brilliant case history of how the world works.</p></p><p>Sven Beckert is Laird Bell Professor of American History at Harvard University. He is also the author of The Monied Metropolis: New York and the Consolidation of the American Bourgeoisie.A masterpiece of the historian&#39;s craft: combining a global scope with concern for the nuances of individual experience, Beckert tracks the fortunes of a single commodity, cotton, across six continents and thousands of years. That sweeping project is driven by the attempt to unravel the causes and consequences of one overarching puzzle: &#34;why, after many millennia of slow economic growth, a few strands of humanity in the late eighteenth century suddenly got much richer.&#34; On the way to his answer, Beckert uncovers a history he claims &#34;provides the key to understanding the modern world.&#34; . . . The belief that discovering the origins of economic growth might unlock modernity&#39;s secrets raises questions that are even more tantalizing -- Timothy Shenk * The Nation * A fascinating and profound examination of the history of a crop that played a transformative role in the making of the modern world. Beckert manages to keep in view a remarkable cast of characters, from planters and slaves in the United States to British industrialists and factory workers, and farmers in India, Egypt, and China. The Empire of Cotton is global history as it should be written -- Eric Foner Masterly . . . Deeply researched and eminently readable, &#34;Empire of Cotton&#34; gives new insight into the relentless expansion of global capitalism. With graceful prose and a clear and compelling argument, Beckert not only charts the expansion of cotton capitalism. . . he addresses the conditions of enslaved workers in the fields and wage workers in the factories. An astonishing achievement -- Thomas Bender * NY Times * Persuasive . . . brilliant . . . Beckert&#39;s detailed narrative never scants the rich complexity of the cotton trade&#39;s impact on many different societies -- Wendy Smith * Boston Globe * Empire of Cotton&#39; proves Sven Beckert one of the new elite of genuinely global historians. Too little present-day academic history is written for the general public. &#39;Empire of Cotton&#39; transcends this barrier and should be devoured eagerly, not only by scholars and students but also by the intelligent reading public. The book is rich and diverse in the treatment of its subject. The writing is elegant, and the use of both primary and secondary sources is impressive and varied. Overviews on international trends alternate with illuminating, memorable anecdotes . . . Beckert&#39;s book made me wish for a sequel -- Daniel Walker Howe * The Washington Post * Important . . .a major work of scholarship that will not be soon surpassed as the definitive account of the product that was, as Beckert puts it, the Industrial Revolution&#39;s &#39;launching pad -- Adam Hochschild * New York Times Book Review * Hefty, informative, and engaging . . . Beckert&#39;s narrative skills keep the story of capitalism fresh and interesting for all readers * Publishers Weekly * An engrossing narrative -- Giorgio Riello * History Today * Beckert is a big-order thinker. His book offers a masterly picture of the empire of cotton as an economic system that held together myriad different parts...Beckert&#39;s ability to write a history on this scale is impressive indeed -- Stephanie McCurry * Times Literary Supplement * Sven Beckert&#39;s Empire of Cotton: A Global History is certainly a must-read for specialists as well as the lay reader.

Professor S�enz-Badillos sets Hebrew in the context of the Northwest Semitic languages and examines the origins of Hebrew and its earliest manifestations in ancient Biblical poetry, inscriptions, and prose written before the Babylonian exile. He looks at the different medieval traditions of pointing classical Biblical Hebrew texts and the characteristic features of the post-exilic language, including the Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls. He gives particular attention to Rabbinic and medieval Hebrew, especially as evidenced in writings from Spain. His survey concludes with the revival of the language in this century in the form of Israeli Hebrew.</p><p>Setting Hebrew in its context, this comprehensive description ranges from its biblical origins and the earliest settlement of the Israelite tribes in Canaan to the present day.

Although Hebrew is an &#39;oriental&#39; language, it is nonetheless closely associated with Western culture as the language of the Bible and was used in writing by the Jews of Europe throughout the Middle Ages.

The Thirst for Annihilation is the first book in English to respond to Bataille&#39;s writings. In no way, though, is Nick Land&#39;s book an attempt to appropriate Bataille&#39;s writings to a secular intelligibility or to compromise with the aridity of academic discourse - rather, it is written as a communion . Theoretical issues in philosophy, sociology, psychodynamics, politics and poetry are discussed, but only as stepping stones into the deep water of textual sacrifice where words pass over into the broken voice of death. Cultural modernity is diagnosed down to its Kantian bedrock with its transcendental philosophy of the object, but Bataille&#39;s writings cut violently across this tightly disciplined reading to reveal the strong underlying currents that bear us towards chaos and dissolution - the violent impulse to escape, the thirst for annihilation.</p><p><strong>`This is an extraordinary book:genre-busting without being merely interdisciplinary, ferociusly argumentative, laden with polemics (some of which are better than Schopenhauer's) and written in a style that occasionally reaches a pitchof aphoristic beauty comparable with Cioran or Nietzsche ...

When the first volume, <em>Early Jazz</em>, appeared two decades ago, it immediately established itself as one of the seminal works on American music. Nat Hentoff called it "a remarkable breakthrough in musical analysis of jazz," and Frank Conroy, in <em>The New York Times Book Review</em>, praised it as "definitive.... A remarkable book by any standard...unparalleled in the literature of jazz." It has been universally recognized as the basic musical analysis of jazz from its beginnings until 1933. <br> <em>The Swing Era</em> focuses on that extraordinary period in American musical history--1933 to 1945--when jazz was synonymous with America's popular music, its social dances and musical entertainment. The book's thorough scholarship, critical perceptions, and great love and respect for jazz puts this well-remembered era of American music into new and revealing perspective. It examines how the arrangements of Fletcher Henderson and Eddie Sauter--whom Schuller equates with Richard Strauss as "a master of harmonic modulation"--contributed to Benny Goodman's finest work...how Duke Ellington used the highly individualistic trombone trio of Joe "Tricky Sam" Nanton, Juan Tizol, and Lawrence Brown to enrich his elegant compositions...how Billie Holiday developed her horn-like instrumental approach to singing...and how the seminal compositions and arrangements of the long-forgotten John Nesbitt helped shape Swing Era styles through their influence on Gene Gifford and the famous Casa Loma Orchestra. Schuller also provides serious reappraisals of such often neglected jazz figures as Cab Calloway, Henry "Red" Allen, Horace Henderson, Pee Wee Russell, and Joe Mooney.<br> Much of the book's focus is on the famous swing bands of the time, which were the essence of the Swing Era. There are the great black bands--Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Jimmie Lunceford, Earl Hines, Andy Kirk, and the often superb but little known "territory bands"--and popular white bands like Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsie, Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman, plus the first serious critical assessment of that most famous of Swing Era bandleaders, Glenn Miller. There are incisive portraits of the great musical soloists--such as Art Tatum, Teddy Wilson, Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, Bunny Berigan, and Jack Teagarden--and such singers as Billie Holiday, Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, and Helen Forest.<br></p><p><br><strong>Gunther Schuller</strong> began his professional career in 1943, at age seventeen, when he played French horn with the Cincinnati Symphony and later served as first horn in the Metropolitan Opera. A prominent American composer, he has written a wide range of orchestral and chamber music, as well as jazz compositions.<br>Twenty years after the publication of Early Jazz , French hornist, conductor, composer, educator and broadcaster Schuller brings forth this 900-page second volume in his monumental "History of Jazz." He is perhaps better equipped to analyze style and technique than anyone else who has written about this music. No previous critic has delineated in as great detail how the various styles developed and coalesced. Schuller devotes 40 pages to Louis Armstrong, 110 pages and 62 musical examples to Duke Ellington. He identifies the unique characteristics of each of the big bandsamong them, Count Basie, Benny Carter, Lionel Hampton, Coleman Hawkins, Fletcher and Horace Henderson, Earl Hines, Jimmie Lunceford and Chick Webb; of arrangers Mel Powell, Don Redman and Eddie Sauter; of such soloists as Bunny Berigan, Charlie Christian, Roy Eldridge, Billie Holiday, Art Tatum, Jack Teagarden, Ben Webster and Teddy Wilson; of the small groups of Nate Cole, John Kirby, Red Nichols and Rex Stewart; even of the "territory bands" of the Middle West. He also explicates the contributions of the big white bands of Charlie Barnet, Bob Crosby, Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, Woody Herman, Harry James, Gene Krupa, Glenn Miller and Claude Thornhill, who, by codifying and expanding upon the innovations of their black counterparts, played as crucial a role and brought jazz to millions who otherwise would never have heard any jazz at all. Schuller's evaluations are original, trenchant and even-handed: He discusses shortcomingsstylistic stultification, topheavy sound, exuberant vulgarity, for exampleas well as achievements. And he demonstrates the gradual atrophying of swing by repetition, formularization, the reduction of improvisation and loss of spontaneity. More brilliantly than anyone before him, Schuller has explained a glorious period in the history of American music.

When it was first published in 1962, it was a landmark event in the history and philosophy of science. Fifty years later, it still has many lessons to teach. <br><br>With <i>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, </i>Kuhn challenged long-standing linear notions of scientific progress, arguing that transformative ideas don&#x2019;t arise from the day-to-day, gradual process of experimentation and data accumulation but that the revolutions in science, those breakthrough moments that disrupt accepted thinking and offer unanticipated ideas, occur outside of &#x201c;normal science,&#x201d; as he called it. Though Kuhn was writing when physics ruled the sciences, his ideas on how scientific revolutions bring order to the anomalies that amass over time in research experiments are still instructive in our biotech age. <br><br>This new edition of Kuhn&#x2019;s essential work in the history of science includes an insightful introduction by Ian Hacking, which clarifies terms popularized by Kuhn, including paradigm and incommensurability, and applies Kuhn&#x2019;s ideas to the science of today. Usefully keyed to the separate sections of the book, Hacking&#x2019;s introduction provides important background information as well as a contemporary context. &nbsp;Newly designed, with an expanded index, this edition will be eagerly welcomed by the next generation of readers seeking to understand the history of our perspectives on science. </p></p><p><b>Thomas S. Kuhn</b> (1922&#x2013;96) was the Laurence Rockefeller Professor of linguistics and philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His books include <i>The Essential Tension</i>;<i> Black-Body Theory and the Quantum Discontinuity, 1894&#x2013;1912</i>; and <i>The Copernican Revolution.</i><br>&#x201c;Like Thomas Kuhn, Ian Hacking has a gift for clear exposition. His introduction provides a helpful guide to some of the thornier philosophical issues. . . . We may still admire Kuhn&#x2019;s dexterity in broaching challenging ideas with a fascinating mix of examples from psychology, history, philosophy, and beyond. We need hardly agree with each of Kuhn&#x2019;s propositions to enjoy&#x2014;and benefit from&#x2014;this classic book.&#x201d;<br> (David Kaiser <i>Nature</i>)<br><br><i>"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i> did a gestalt flip on just about every assumption about the who, how, and what of scientific progress. . . . The book still vibrates our culture&#x2019;s walls like a trumpet call. History of science may not have become exactly what Kuhn thought it should, but <i>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i> knocked it off its existing tracks.&#x201d;<br> (<i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;So long as there are still paradigms among us, the achievements of Thomas Kuhn will be remembered.&#x201d;<br> (<i>National Post (Canada)</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;One of the most influential books of the 20th century. . . .

This first book in the Classroom Strategies That Work library includes a summary of key research behind these classroom practices and shows how to implement them using step-by-step hands-on strategies. Dr. Robert J. Marzano translates theory into action, details the impact of well-designed and well-taught goals and objectives, and offers recommendations for classroom practice. Short quizzes help readers assess their understanding of the instructional best practices explained in each section. Use this book as a personal resource or as a group study tool.</p><p>Dr. Robert J. Marzano is the cofounder and CEO of Marzano Research Laboratory in Denver, Colorado.

His books include: Designing and Assessing Educational Objectives, Making Standards Useful, and The Art and Science of Teaching. His practical translations of the most current research and theory into classroom strategies are internationally known and widely practiced by both teachers and administrators. He received a bachelor s degree from Iona College in New York, a master s degree from Seattle University, and a doctorate from the University of Washington.In Designing and Teaching Learning Goals and Objectives, Robert Marzano brilliantly translates goal-setting research into thought-provoking and doable professional practice. In chapter two, he makes important distinctions between goals and assignments and shows readers how to translate general standards statements into specific learning goals. As a result, educators can (1) become much more precise about what they want their students to know and be able to do and (2) be better able to effectively communicate these specific learning goals to their students.<p>In chapter three, Dr. Marzano provides both the rationale and process for developing student learning goals at four different levels of difficulty the very essence of differentiation to assist educators in better meeting the diverse learning needs of all their students: By designing goals at different difficulty levels, the teacher can ensure that each student is challenged without being overwhelmed. Educators need to know before planning instruction the level of thinking difficulty a particular learning goal represents so they can design a matching set of aligned instruction, learning tasks, and assessments that will provide credible evidence as to whether students have achieved the targeted goal and at what degree of proficiency. Such alignment will enable teachers to more accurately diagnose specific student learning needs and modify their instruction accordingly. --Larry Ainsworth, author of Power Standards and Unwrapping the Standards, coauthor of Common Formative Assessments, Five Easy Steps to a Balanced Math Program, and Student-Generated Rubrics<br><br>With a penetrating research perspective, Marzano and his team provide classroom teachers and school administrators with a fresh look at a timeless problem: How do we create meaningful goals and objectives that actually make a difference for our learners? To the prospective reader, open this book and find specific methods to enliven your curriculum, focus your instructional approach, and to actively engage your learners. I believe Designing and Teaching Learning Goals and Objectives: Classroom Strategies That Work is destined to become an education classic. --Dr. Heidi Hayes Jacobs, executive director of the Curriculum Mapping Institute</p></p><h2>Excel 2010 For Dummies(r)</h2><p><b>The bestselling Excel book on the market, updated for Excel 2010</b> <p>As the world's leading spreadsheet application, Excel has a huge user base.

Yet remarkably few historians or philosophers have attempted to trace the process of ideas from the political and social turmoil of the late eighteenth century to the present day. This is precisely what Jonathan Israel now does. <br><br>In <em>Democratic Enlightenment</em>, Israel demonstrates that the Enlightenment was an essentially revolutionary process, driven by philosophical debate. The American Revolution and its concerns certainly acted as a major factor in the intellectual ferment that shaped the wider upheaval that followed, but the radical philosophes were no less critical than enthusiastic about the American model. From 1789, the General Revolution's impetus came from a small group of philosophe-revolutionnaires, men such as Mirabeau, Sieyes, Condorcet, Volney, Roederer, and Brissot. Not aligned to any of the social groups represented in the French National assembly, they nonetheless forged "la philosophie moderne"-in effect Radical Enlightenment ideas-into a world-transforming ideology that had a lasting impact in Latin America, Canada and Eastern Europe as well as France, Italy, Germany, and the Low Countries. In addition, Israel argues that while all French revolutionary journals powerfully affirmed that la philosophie moderne was the main cause of the French Revolution, the main stream of historical thought has failed to grasp what this implies. Israel sets the record straight, demonstrating the true nature of the engine that drove the Revolution, and the intimate links between the radical wing of the Enlightenment and the anti-Robespierriste "Revolution of reason."<br></p><p><br><strong>Jonathan Israel </strong>is Professor of Modern History at the Institute for Advance Study, Princeton.

Instead, they advocate for the long-ignored but most crucial factor in therapeutic success-the innate resources of the client. Based on extensive clinical research and case studies, The Heroic Client not only shows how to harness the client&#39;s powers of regeneration to make therapy effective, but also how to enlist the client as a partner to make therapy accountable. The Heroic Client inspires therapists to boldly rewrite the drama of therapy, recast clients in their rightful role as heroes and heroines of the therapeutic stage, and legitimize their services to third-party payers without the compromises of the medical model.</p><p>The Thoroughly Revised Edition of the Book That Will Lead Psychotherapy Out of the Stone Age and Into the Age of The Heroic Client <p>This revised edition of The Heroic Client presents the latest empirical findings about what works in therapy&#x2013;featuring the revolutionary increase in effectiveness achieved via client-based outcome feedback.

The period also witnessed a violent conflict in Asia Minor between warring peoples in the region, a conflict commonly believed to be the historical basis for Homer's Trojan War. <em>The Oxford Handbook of the Bronze Age Aegean</em> provides a detailed survey of these fascinating aspects of the period, and many others, in sixty-six newly commissioned articles. <br><br>Divided into four sections, the handbook begins with <em>Background and Definitions</em>, which contains articles establishing the discipline in its historical, geographical, and chronological settings and in its relation to other disciplines. The second section, <em>Chronology and Geography</em>, contains articles examining the Bronze Age Aegean by chronological period (Early Bronze Age, Middle Bronze Age, Late Bronze Age). Each of the periods are further subdivided geographically, so that individual articles are concerned with Mainland Greece during the Early Bronze Age, Crete during the Early Bronze Age, the Cycladic Islands during the Early Bronze Age, and the same for the Middle Bronze Age, followed by the Late Bronze Age. The third section, <em>Thematic and Specific Topics</em>, includes articles examining thematic topics that cannot be done justice in a strictly chronological/geographical treatment, including religion, state and society, trade, warfare, pottery, writing, and burial customs, as well as specific events, such as the eruption of Santorini and the Trojan War. The fourth section, <em>Specific Sites and Areas</em>, contains articles examining the most important regions and sites in the Bronze Age Aegean, including Mycenae, Tiryns, Pylos, Knossos, Kommos, Rhodes, the northern Aegean, and the Uluburun shipwreck, as well as adjacent areas such as the Levant, Egypt, and the western Mediterranean.<br><br>Containing new work by an international team of experts, <em>The Oxford Handbook of the Bronze Age Aegean</em> represents the most comprehensive, authoritative, and up-to-date single-volume survey of the field.

Taking a structuralist approach to the relation between Nietzsche's thought and his life, Klossowski emphasizes the centrality of the notion of Eternal Return (a cyclical notion of time and history) for understanding Nietzsche's propensities for self-denial, self-reputation, and self-consumption.<br> <br> Nietzsche's ideas did not stem from personal pathology, according to Klossowski. Rather, he made a pathological use of his best ideas, anchoring them in his own fluctuating bodily and mental conditions. Thus Nietzsche's belief that questions of truth and morality are at base questions of power and fitness resonates dynamically and intellectually with his alternating lucidity and delirium.</p></p><p>Klossowski, brother of the painter Balthus, is widely rcognized as a central figure in the contemporary French avant-garde.^Daniel W.

The four subperiods of Shang, Western Zhou, Spring and Autumn and Warring States, are described on the basis of literary and material sources and the evidence of recently found manuscripts. Chapters on the prehistoric background, the growth of language, and relations with the peoples of Central Asia provide the major context of China&#39;s achievements in the 1,500 years under review. The teachings of China&#39;s early masters are set alongside what is known of the methods of astonomers, physicians and diviners. A final chapter leads the reader forward to imperial times, as described in the volumes of The Cambridge History of China.</p><p>The Cambridge History of Ancient China provides a survey of the cultural history of pre-imperial China. Fourteen of the leading Western specialists, both historians and archeologists, cover the Shang, Western Zhou, Spring and Autumn, Warring States, Neolithic background, language, intellectual history, relations with Central Asia, and debts of both the Qin and Han empires to these earlier time-periods.

But in this book, Peter Boag opens an extraordinary window onto the real Old West. Delving into countless primary sources and surveying sexological and literary sources, Boag paints a vivid picture of a West where cross-dressing&#x2015;for both men and women&#x2015;was pervasive, and where easterners as well as Mexicans and even Indians could redefine their gender and sexual identities. Boag asks, why has this history been forgotten and erased? Citing a cultural moment at the turn of the twentieth century&#x2015;when the frontier ended, the United States entered the modern era, and homosexuality was created as a category&#x2015;Boag shows how the American people, and thus the American nation, were bequeathed an unambiguous heterosexual identity.</p><p>&#x201c;An important, persuasive, and fascinating intervention in the literature on the American frontier." &#x2015;Lisa Duggan, author of <i>The Twilight of Equality? Neoliberalism, Cultural Politics, and the Attack on Democracy</i><br>&#x201c;Peter Boag's <i>Re-dressing America's Frontier Past</i> does just that: it re-imagines the American West as a place where cross-dressing is abundant and its meanings are as varied as the individuals themselves. Vividly written and broad in scope, Boag's compelling narrative debunks the gendered myths of the west and writes hundreds of stories back into history.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x2015;Nan Alamilla Boyd, author of <i>Wide-Open Town: A History of Queer San Francisco to 1965</i><br>&#x201c;Peter Boag&#x2019;s <i>Re-Dressing America&#x2019;s Frontier Past</i> invites readers to reimagine fundamental ideas about sex, gender, and the history of the American West. Brilliant and perceptive, Boag rediscovers a past that once existed but that was forgotten as new ideas about sexuality emerged in the early twentieth century. Boag makes the lives of the West&#x2019;s many cross-dressers central to his narrative, and the world they reveal gives us an opportunity to understand history in ways that are more comprehensive and humane. Boag's book sheds new light on the American frontier as well as the history of sex and gender.&#x201d; &#x2015;Albert Hurtado, author of <i>Intimate Frontiers: Sex, Gender, and Culture in Old California</i><br><br>&#x201c;Peter Boag uncovers the rich and heretofore hidden history of cross dressers with wit and wisdom, humor and humanity. He adds another crucial layer to our understanding of the West's complicated gendered past and in the process demolishes the region's mythical identity as a virile, white, masculine, heterosexual frontier. The book illuminates the sources of that limited view and liberates us from it.&#x201d; &#x2015;Sherry L. Smith, author of <i>Reimaging Indians: Native Americans Through Anglo Eyes, 1880-1940</i><br><br>&#x201c;A fascinating excursion into a side of western life rarely acknowledged today but surprisingly open and remarked upon at the time. Boag's thoughts on the reasons for the historical blurring are as provocative as his stories are intriguing and often poignant.&#x201d; &#x2015;Elliott West, author of <i>The Last Indian War: The Nez Perce Story</i><br><br>&#x201c;This book by the foremost historian of sexuality in the American West is a classic before its time. The history of Westerns cross-dressing is placed within numerous historical contexts, deeply researched, and presented with multiple nuances and thorough analysis. At the same time, we learn of the personal, of the many people who might never have had their significant stories. A stellar and stunning work!&#x201d; &#x2015;John R. Wunder, author of &#x201c;Writing of Race, Class, Gender, and Power in the American West&#x201d; in <i>North America: Tensions and (Re)Solutions</i><br><br>&#x201c;Original and provocative&#x2015;Boag finds ample evidence of women and men in western towns and cities who challenged familiar binaries of heteronormative manhood and womanhood through cross-dressing, same-sex intimacy, and trans-gendered identities. But the real story is how communities made meaning of these identities. Boag links sexologists&#x2019; promotion of heteronormativity with notions of a redemptive frontier, anti-modernism, and national identity. The results are entirely new perspectives on the imagined West and its place in American history.&#x201d; &#x2015;Dee Garceau-Hagen, editor of <i>Across the Great Divide: Cultures of Manhood in the American West</i><br><br><b>Peter Boag</b> holds the Columbia Chair in the History of the American West at Washington State University.

Fabio Trabocchi's soul is in the Italian province of Le Marche. Equidistant from Rome and Florence, Le Marche is on the Adriatic coast, bordered to the north by Emilia-Romagna, to the west by Tuscany and Umbria, and to the south by Lazio and Abruzzo. This geography accounts for the rich variety of Le Marche's food traditions. The first chefs of Le Marche assimilated recipes, ingredients, and techniques from visiting mariners from Greece and North Africa. In his debut cookbook, Trabocchi showcases his signature style of cooking&#x2014;called "soulful and passionate&#x2014;not pretentious" by <em>Food &amp; Wine</em>&#x2014;combining traditional elements of Italian cuisine with a contemporary European sensibility that draws on the many flavors he's experienced throughout his extensive travels and techniques honed at restaurants around the world.</p></p><p><p>Fabio Trabocchi discovered his passion for cooking as a young boy, inspired by his father's love for food from his native region of Ancona, Italy. At the age when many chefs are still sharpening their skills and palates, he has already earned an impressive foothold in the culinary world. After winning the London Carlton Restaurant Award for Best New Chef in 1999, Fabio Trabocchi moved to the Washington, D.C., area to create his vision and concept for Maestro, where is the chef. Both he and the restaurant have won several accolades, including Maestro's being named by <em>Gourmet</em> as one of the World's Best Hotel Dining Rooms. In 2004 and 2003, he was nominated for Rising Star Chef by the James Beard Foundation, and in 2006 he won Best Chef: Mid-Atlantic, an award he also was nominated for in 2005.</p>Trabocchi, chef at Maestro in Washington, D.C., is a native son of Le Marche, the Italian region that the <i>New York Times</i> recently deemed "the new Tuscany." Trabocchi grew up in the small town of Santo Stefano, and with assistance from Kaminsky (<i>Pig Perfect</i>) he achieves a lovely style that is rather low-key in comparison to the commanding tone many chefs affect in cookbooks. Trabocchi also does an excellent job of isolating the best, most characteristic recipes from Le Marche, as <i>cucina marchigiana</i> is often difficult to differentiate from that of Umbria or Emilia-Romagna. Yet what makes the food of Le Marche so special is its rustic quality, which is hard to imitate in American kitchens. It's fun to read about dishes like Roasted Suckling Pig Ascolana-Style and Turbot in Smoky Hay, but preparing them may be out of reach ("You will need to get clean green hay from a local farm," instructs the latter recipe). Fried Stuffed Olives Ascolana-Style, one of the region's classics, calls for pitting, stuffing (with a mixture of chicken liver and pork butt) and deep-frying 60 individual olives. There are less labor-intensive choices, such as Ancona's famous fish stew, and Trabocchi includes an excellent discussion of local wines. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Following introductory chapters that discuss color, fiber, tools, and patterns, the patterns themselves begin. Divided by the length of time it takes to complete each project (some less than 2 hours!), the book shows off a wide array of gifts. The quickest include angora baby booties, a kerchief scarf, and potholders. If the knitter is able to take a little longer, there's time to make leg warmers, hats, and scarves. Sweaters, knit toys, and a felted yoga bag take only 4 to 6 hours (provided, of course, that the knitter doesn't abandon the project for a year or so). Lush color photographs make every one of these items look like a winner, and the directions are clear and easy to follow.

He wrote incessantly&#x2015;corresponding with friends, composing performance scores, making production notes for television projects, drafting plans for video installations, writing essays and articles. Celebrated for his visionary development of new artistic tools and for his pioneering work in video and television, Paik often wrote to sharpen his thinking and hone his ideas. He used the typewriter to fashion sentences that broke apart and reassembled themselves as he wrote, producing both poetic texts and aesthetic objects on the page. This first extensive collection of Paik's writings includes many previously unpublished and out-of-print texts. </p><p>Drawing on materials from the Smithsonian American Art Museum's Nam June Paik Archive and from a range of international publications, <i>We Are in Open Circuits</i> offers important but long-unavailable essays, including &#x201c;Global Groove and Video Common Market&#x201d;; unpublished writings on such topics as his creative partnership with the cellist Charlotte Moorman and the role of public television; a substantial part of his compilation &#x201c;Scrutable Chinese&#x201d;; and detailed plans for some of his groundbreaking broadcast works, including the trio <i>Good Morning, Mr. Orwell</i> (1984), <i>Bye Bye Kipling</i> (1986), and <i>Wrap Around the World</i> (1988). It also includes nearly 150 pages that reproduce Paik's original typed and handwritten pages, letting readers see his writing in various stages of inspiration and execution.</p></p><p>John G. Hanhardt is an independent curator of film and the media arts and has curated Nam June Paik retrospectives at the Whitney Museum of American Art, Guggenheim Museum, and Smithsonian American Art Museum.<br><br>Gregory Zinman is Assistant Professor in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication at Georgia Tech.<br><br>Edith Decker-Phillips is an art historian and the author of <i>Paik Video</i>.<p>&#x201c;Best known for his groundbreaking video art, Nam June Paik is less celebrated for his brilliant writing, but this volume&nbsp;will certainly change that. Often utopian, occasionally bawdy, Paik's writing is always prescient; it is no exaggeration to claim that he understood the social and political potential of the Internet long before it existed. His media theory helps to situate the history of television, and especially its apparent democratization in cable TV and art, as the still relevant foundation for our current digital age.&#x201d;</p>&#x2015;<b>David Joselit</b>, author of&nbsp;<i>Feedback: Television Against Democracy</i></p><h2>The Mysterious Stranger and Other Stories (Dover Thrift Editions: Short Stories)</h2><p>The author of outstanding travel books, autobiographical works and novels, including the classic <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i>, Mark Twain (Samuel Langhorne Clemens, 1835&#x2013;1910) is regarded by many as America's finest humorist and a major writer of short stories.<br>The four selections in this volume span his entire writing career and are among his best-known stories. They include: "The Notorious Jumping Frog of Calaveras County," one of Twain's most amusing pieces of folk humor, first published in 1865; "The �1,000,000 Bank Note," a lighthearted exploration of the power of money; "The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg," a masterfully written short story about greed; and his last work, "The Mysterious Stranger," a novelette published posthumously in 1916, presenting Twain's rather grim views of God, man, and the universe.</p><p>After the Civil War, Samuel Clemens (1835&#x2013;1910) left his small town to seek work as a riverboat pilot. As Mark Twain, the Missouri native found his place in the world. Author, journalist, lecturer, wit, and sage, Twain created enduring works that have enlightened and amused readers of all ages for generations.</p><h2>The Demon Princes, Vol. 1: The Star King * The Killing Machine * The Palace of Love (Demon Princes, 1)</h2><p><p>Kirth Gersen carries in his pocket a slip of paper with a list of five names written on it. Theses are the names of the five Demon Princes who led the historic Mount Pleasant Massacre, which destroyed not only Kirth's family but his entrire world as well. He roams the universe, searching the endless galaxies of space, hunting down the Demon Princes and exacting his revenge. Three princes will fall before Kirth's work is done, and two more await their doom...</p></p><p>Jack Vance excels at writing a series of shorter works that together comprise a grand, interstellar adventure. Such is the <i>The Demon Princes,</i> a series of five tales that chronicle Kirth Gersen's quest for vengeance against the five demon princes. The princes led the Mount Pleasant Massacre, a raid that destroyed Gersen's family and his world. But now Kirth is on their trail, and no matter how many galaxies there are to search, he will find them one by one and exact his revenge. This first volume collects three of the five Demon Prince stories, while the second volume will carry the remaining two.<b>Jack Vance</b> (1916-2013) was was a sailor, a writer, an adventurer, a music critic, and one of the greatest masters of fantasy and science fiction.

Confronted by the endless challenges of daily life, the Peterkins rise to every occasion with misguided aplomb: they sit out in the sun for hours and fail to go for a ride because they&#x2019;ve forgotten to unhitch the horse, they play the piano from the porch through the parlor window because the movers left the keyboard turned that way, they decide to raise the ceiling to accommodate a too-tall Christmas tree. Only the timely intervention of their great and good friend, the Lady from Philadelphia, can be counted on to get the Peterkins out of their latest scrape.<br><br>A classic of American children&#x2019;s literature and a masterpiece of deadpan drollery, <i>The Peterkin Papers</i> restore our astonishment at the ordinary, finding a rich vein of humor and happy surprise in the mere fact of our surviving the trivialities and tribulations of family life.</p><p><b>LUCRETIA P. HALE</b> (1820-1900) is best known as the author of a series of stories about a family named Peterkin, the first of which appeared in 1867 in the magazine <i>Our Young Folks</i> (later <i>St. Nicholas Magazine</i>). The series continued for nine years, and made the Peterkins a household name. In addition to writing, Hale helped her brother Edward edit the <i>Old and New Magazine</i> from 1870 to 1875. She was concerned with education and in 1874 was one of the first six women elected to the Boston School Committee, where she served two terms.

And his nonangling friends and family may never again entirely recognize him, either.&#x201d; In other words, he (or she) will have entered Gierach territory. And fishermen who choose to brave the crowds at the big hold, commune with the buddies at the &#x201c;family pool,&#x201d; or even wade into questionable waters in the dark of night are sure to recognize themselves in <i>Even Brook Trout Get the Blues.</i><br><br>Whether debating bamboo versus graphite rods, describing the pleasure of fishing in pocket waters or during a spring snow in the mountains, or recounting a trip in pursuit of the &#x201c;fascinatingly ugly&#x201d; longnose gar, Gierach understands that fly-fishing is more than a sport. It&#x2019;s a way of life in which patience is (mostly) rewarded, the rhythms of the natural world are appreciated, and the search for the perfect rod or ideal stream is never ending. It is not a life without risks, for as Gierach warns: &#x201c;This perspective on things can change you irreparably. If it comes to you early enough in life, it can save you from ever becoming what they call &#x2018;normal.&#x2019;&#x201d; <i>Even Brook Trout Get the Blues</i> will convince you that &#x201c;normal&#x201d; is greatly overrated.</p><p>John Gierach is the author of&nbsp;more than twenty books about fly-fishing. His writing has appeared in&nbsp;<i>Field &amp; Stream, Gray&#x2019;s Sporting Journal</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Fly Rod &amp; Reel</i>, where he is a regular columnist. He also writes a column for the monthly&nbsp;<i>Redstone Review</i>. He lives in Lyons, Colorado.&nbsp;Fine, sweetly written essays on the sport and art of fly- fishing, by a writer who thinks of himself as ``a reporter rather than an expert.'' A Colorado outdoorsman, Gierach (Sex, Death, and Fly-Fishing, 1990) views fly-fishing as ``a healthy antisocial sport'' that ``has become a highly refined ritualistic food-gathering technique in which damned little food gets gathered.'' Gierach fishes everything from glamour spots like the Kenosha Trout Club, where aficionados use thousand-dollar, custom-made bamboo rods, to simple farm ponds stocked because ``something in the collective rural American consciousness...abhors a fishless body of water.'' After trout, the author also wets an occasional fly primarily for bluegill, bass, and--sacrilege amongst purists--gar and northern pike. His technical discussions of fly-tying, rods, tippets, hatches, and water temperature flow into the narrative and emphasize that ``simply getting better is probably the ultimate goal of the sport.'' One of his best pieces, ``The Poacher,'' is a delightful portrait of his friend, Harvey, a local legend and ``regulation hippie/redneck hybrid'' who repeatedly cons Gierach into fishing on private property. Harvey totes a .380 automatic pistol and has been known to cut through a farmer's locked fence in pursuit of large brown trout. More law-abiding but no less persistent, Gierach's other fishing pals share the author's passion and skill (``a nebulous thing based largely on seasoned intuition'') on waters in Wyoming, Montana, and numerous spots in Colorado and the Rockies. With great good humor, Gierach casts his words in the tradition of the finest sportswriting. (Line drawings throughout.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Interviews reveal the never-before-heard story of the Black Panthers&#x2019; R&amp;B band the Lumpen and how five rank-and-file members performed popular music for revolutionaries.&nbsp; Beyond the mainstream civil rights movement that is typically discussed are the stories of the Black Panthers, the Black Arts Movement, the antiwar activism, and other radical movements that were central to the impulse that transformed black popular music&#x2014;and created <i>soul</i> music.</p><p><p><b>Rickey Vincent</b> is the author of <i>Funk:&nbsp;The Music, The People, and the Rhythm of the One</i> and has written for the <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>American Legacy</i>, and the <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i>.

Combined with Vincent&#x2019;s beautifully readable style, the results are a definitive work on the late 60s black revolution and its previously neglected soundtrack." &#x2014;<i>Record Collector</i><br><br>"A fascinating history of the Black Panthers, their house band and the music that inspired them. Rickey Vincent is well qualified to tell the story of the Black Panthers; his mother was a party member, his father a black politics historian and it's that combination of first-person insight and thorough research that makes this book so riveting. Like the Panthers, Vincent thinks outside the box, telling their story through the lens of The Lumpen, the Panthers' house band. ... Vincent takes each song played at a 1970 Oakland show as the springboard for discussion. For example: Their radical reworking of Sly And The Family Stones' 'Dance To The Music' leads to a brief history of Sly; the intelligent debate on the Bay Area counter culture revolution, the 10 point programme and so on." &#x2014;<i>MOJO</i>, Four Stars</p><h2>True Colors: World Masters of Natural Dyes and Pigments</h2><p><i>True Colors</i> is about artists who create color from natural materials and about the historical importance and environmental sustainability of this practice.

Traditional approaches to making color offer sustainable options to a fashion system badly in need of them and memorable cultural narratives to a world hungry for beauty and spirituality. <i>True Colors</i> provides an immersive visual experience and an inspiring travelogue of personal stories and practical information from artists who are leaving their mark on the world.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Keith Recker</b>&nbsp;is President and co-founder of <i>HAND/EYE</i> magazine, a multidisciplinary journal of global handmade creativity.

It is shocking how little most of us know about how the natural world has yielded its colors to us for millennia, even though it&#x2019;s only been a tiny blip of time in human history that we have been relying on synthetic dyes. What&#x2019;s even more shocking is that nearly every one of the methods Recker highlights&#x2014;from indigo to cochineal&#x2014;had all but died out in the very communities where people had once practiced them for generations.

Scores of them, crumpled and broken.</p> <p>JT looked around for movement and saw none. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s clear.&#x201d;</p> <p>He stepped outside and held the door as the line of infected people shambled out.</p> <p>Adults and children.</p> <p>Billy Trout and JT&#x2019;s partner, Desdemona Fox, came last, each of them holding a small child in their arms.</p> <p>The National Guardsmen popped several flares on the far side of the parking lot to attract the masses of living dead. On that side of the lot, behind the chain-link fence, all of the Guard trucks sent up a continuous wail with their sirens. The dead shuffled that way, drawn by light and noise.</p> <p>One of the victims, a man who had been bitten by what had been his own wife and children, stared glassily at the stiffly moving bodies. Then he raised a weak arm and pointed to the soldiers.</p> <p>&#x201c;Are they coming to help us?&#x201d; he asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re coming,&#x201d; said Dez, hating herself for the implied lie. She told the wounded to sit down by the wall. Some of them immediately fell asleep; others stared with empty eyes at the glowing flares high in the sky.</p> <p>For a moment it left Dez, JT, and Trout as the only ones standing, each of them holding a dying child. The tableau was horrific and surreal. They stared at each other, frozen into this moment because the next was too horrible to contemplate. Then they saw movement.</p> <p>JT peered into the shadows. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re coming.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;The Guard?&#x201d; asked Dez, a last flicker of hope in her eyes.</p> <p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said.</p> <p>They heard the moans. For whatever reason, pulled by some other aspect of their hunger, a few of the dead had not followed the flares and the sirens, and now they staggered toward the living standing by the open door. More of them rounded the corner of the building. Perhaps drawn by a more powerful force.</p> <p>The smell of fresh meat.</p> <p>&#x201c;We have to go,&#x201d; said Trout.</p> <p>&#x201c;And right now,&#x201d; agreed JT. He kissed the little boy on the cheek and set him down on the ground between two sleeping infected. Trout sighed brokenly and did the same. Dez Fox clung to the little girl in her arms.</p> <p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s more of them,&#x201d; said Trout.</p> <p>&#x201c;Dez, come on&#x2026;&#x201d; murmured JT.</p> <p>But Dez turned away as if protecting the little girl she held from him. &#x201c;Please, Hoss&#x2026;?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Dez.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t!&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Give her to me, honey,&#x201d; JT said gently. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take care of her. Don&#x2019;t worry.&#x201d;</p> <p>It took everything Dez had left to allow JT to take the sleeping girl from her arms. She shook her head, hating him, hating the world, hating everything.</p> <p>&#x201c;Better get inside,&#x201d; JT warned. Some of the zombies were very close now. Twenty paces.</p> <p>Trout ran to the door. &#x201c;Dez, JT, come on. We have to go. We can&#x2019;t leave this open or they&#x2019;ll get inside.&#x201d;</p> <p>Dez reluctantly moved toward the door, backing away from the child she had to abandon. Trout reached and took her hand, and when she returned his squeeze it was crushingly painful. He pulled her toward the door as the first of the dead stepped into the pale glow thrown by the emergency light.</p> <p>&#x201c;JT, come on, let&#x2019;s go!&#x201d; Trout yelled.</p> <p>The big cop did not move. He held the little girl so gently, stroking her hair and murmuring to her.</p> <p>&#x201c;JT!&#x201d; cried Dez. &#x201c;We have to close the door!&#x201d;</p> <p>He smiled at her. &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;you do.&#x201d;</p> <p>They waited for him to come, but he stayed where he was.</p> <p>&#x201c;JT?&#x201d; Dez asked in a small, frightened voice. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;</p> <p>JT kissed the little girl&#x2019;s forehead and set her down with the others. Then he straightened and showed her his wrist. It was crisscrossed with glass cuts from the helicopter attack.</p> <p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; she asked.</p> <p>He pushed his sleeve up.</p> <p>That was when she saw it. A semicircular line of bruised punctures.</p> <p>Dez whimpered something. A question. &#x201c;How?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Upstairs, when those bastards tackled us. One of them got me&nbsp;&#x2026; I didn&#x2019;t see which one. Doesn&#x2019;t matter. What&#x2019;s done is done.&#x201d;</p> <p>Then the full realization hit Dez. <i>&#x201c;NO!&#x201d;</i></p> <p>It was all Trout could do to hold her back. She struggled wildly and even punched him. The blow rocked him, but he did not let go. He would never let go. Never.</p> <p><i>&#x201c;No!&#x201d;</i> Dez yelled. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t!&#x201d;</p> <p>The dead were closing in on JT. He unslung the shotgun. Across the parking lot the last flares were fading and the trucks turned off their sirens, one by one.</p> <p>&#x201c;Go on, honey,&#x201d; JT said.</p> <p>&#x201c;No goddamn way, Hoss,&#x201d; she growled, fighting with Trout, hitting him, hurting him. &#x201c;We stand together and we fucking well go down together.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Not this time,&#x201d; JT said, and he was smiling.</p> <p>Trout could see it even if Dez could not, that JT was at peace with this.</p> <p>&#x201c;No! No! No!&#x201d; Dez kept repeating.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to keep these bastards away from those kids as long as I can,&#x201d; said JT. &#x201c;I need you to go inside. I need you to tell the National Guard to do what they have to do, but make sure they do it right. They got to wipe &#x2019;em all out. All of them.&#x201d;</p> <p>What he meant was as clear as it was horrible.</p> <p>&#x201c;JT&#x2014;don&#x2019;t leave me!&#x201d;</p> <p>He shook his head. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t ever leave you, kid. Not in any way that matters. Now&nbsp;&#x2026; go on. There are eight hundred people inside the school, Dez. There are children inside that building who need you. You can&#x2019;t leave them.&#x201d;</p> <p>And there it was.</p> <p>Dez sagged against Trout and he pulled her inside and held her tight as the door swung shut with a clang.</p> <p>They heard the first blasts of the shotgun. Trout didn&#x2019;t hear the next one because Dez was screaming.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>JT stood with his back to the line of bite victims, holding the shotgun by its double pistol grips, firing, pumping, firing. There was almost no need to aim. There were so many and they were so close. He emptied the gun and used it as a club to kill as many as he could before his arms began to ache. Then he dropped the gun and pulled his Glock. He had one full magazine left.</p> <p>He debated using the bullets on the wounded, but then he heard the whine of the helicopters&#x2019; rotors change, intensify, draw closer; and he knew what would happen next. He just had to keep the monsters away from the children until then. Soon&nbsp;&#x2026; soon it would all be over, and it would happen fast.</p> <p>He took the gun in both hands and fired.</p> <p>And fired.</p> <p>And fired.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Inside the school building, huddled together on the floor, Desdemona Fox and Billy Trout held each other as bullets hammered like cold rain on the walls. It seemed to go on forever. Pain and noise and death seemed to be the only things that mattered anymore.</p> <p>And then&nbsp;&#x2026; silence.</p> <p>Plaster dust drifted down on them as the roar of the helicopters&#x2019; rotors dwindled to faintness and then was gone.</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s over,&#x201d; Trout whispered. He stroked Dez&#x2019;s hair and kissed her head and wept with her. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t ever leave you, Dez. Never.&#x201d;</p> <p>Dez slowly raised her head. Her face was dirty and streaked with tears, and her eyes were filled with grief and hurt. She raised trembling fingers to his face. She touched his cheeks, his ear, his mouth.</p> <p>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; she said.</p> <p>Dez wrapped her arms around Trout with crushing force. He allowed it, gathering her even closer. They clung to one another and sobbed hard enough to shatter the whole ugly world.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2014 by Jonathan Maberry</p></p><h2>Reconquest and Crusade in Medieval Spain (The Middle Ages Series)</h2><p><p>Drawing from both Christian and Islamic sources, <i>Reconquest and Crusade in Medieval Spain</i> demonstrates that the clash of arms between Christians and Muslims in the Iberian peninsula that began in the early eighth century was transformed into a crusade by the papacy during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Successive popes accorded to Christian warriors willing to participate in the peninsular wars against Islam the same crusading benefits offered to those going to the Holy Land. Joseph F. O'Callaghan clearly demonstrates that any study of the history of the crusades must take a broader view of the Mediterranean to include medieval Spain.</p><p>Following a chronological overview of crusading in the Iberian peninsula from the late eleventh to the middle of the thirteenth century, O'Callaghan proceeds to the study of warfare, military finance, and the liturgy of reconquest and crusading. He concludes his book with a consideration of the later stages of reconquest and crusade up to and including the fall of Granada in 1492, while noting that the spiritual benefits of crusading bulls were still offered to the Spanish until the Second Vatican Council of 1963.</p><p>Although the conflict described in this book occurred more than eight hundred years ago, recent events remind the world that the intensity of belief, rhetoric, and action that gave birth to crusade, holy war, and jihad remains a powerful force in the twenty-first century.</p></p><p>Joseph F. O&#39;Callaghan is Professor Emeritus of History at Fordham University. He is the author of many books on Spanish history, including The Gibraltar Crusade: Castile and the Battle for the Strait, also published by the University of Pennsylvania Press, and A History of Medieval Spain.<p>"A survey of royal military activity in Spain from the late eleventh through the mid-thirteenth centuries. . . . The author scrutinizes the ecclesiastical sources of the period to establish the interconnection of papal and Iberian royal plans for warring against the Muslim opposition, . . . arguing for an expanded concept of the Crusades that would include the kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula. . . . Highly recommended."&#x2014;<i>Choice</i></p><br><br><p>"With this study, it becomes difficult to doubt that a broad array of medieval people viewed the conflict against Muslims in Iberia in religious terms and that these wars were appropriately sanctioned by the papacy as crusades."&#x2014;<i>Catholic Historical Review</i></p><br><br><p>"O'Callaghan's book is the first to place the <i>Reconquista</i> within the context of papal support for military action against Islam."&#x2014;<i>Religious Studies Review</i></p><br><br><p>"This is a welcome book. It explains the development of crusading in almost all of its aspects in medieval Iberia as well as situates the Iberian crusades within the context of those to the Holy Land. Indeed, Joseph O'Callaghan demonstrates that the crusades in Iberia and to the Middle East evolved in tandem, and that understanding one movement is requisite for understanding the other."&#x2014;<i>The Medieval Review</i></p><br><br><p>"On the one hand, a masterful synthesis of work done in both crusade and reconquest history and, on the other, a fresh look at the intersection between the two fields, this engaging book tackles the contentious issue of categorizing the Christian military campaigns against Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula."&#x2014;<i>Historian</i></p></p><h2>Fatal Identity: A Romantic Suspense novel (The Fatal Series)</h2><p><em><b>Every family has its secrets...&nbsp;</b></em><br><br>As the first anniversary of her marriage to Vice President Nick Cappuano approaches, Lieutenant Sam Holland is dreaming of Bora Bora&#x2014;sun, sand and a desperately needed break from the DC grind.

Why do we love spices, sweets, coffee? How did rice become such a staple food throughout so much of eastern Asia? Everyone Eats examines the social and cultural reasons for our food choices and provides an explanation of the nutritional reasons for why humans eat what they do, resulting in a unique cultural and biological approach to the topic. E. N. Anderson explains the economics of food in the globalization era; food&#x2019;s relationship to religion, medicine, and ethnicity; and offers suggestions on how to end hunger, starvation, and malnutrition.</p><br><p>This thoroughly updated Second Edition incorporates the latest food scholarship, most notably recognizing the impact of sustainable eating advocacy and the state of food security in the world today. Anderson also brings more insight than ever before into the historical and scientific underpinnings of our food customs, fleshing this out with fifteen new and original photographs from his own extensive fieldwork.</p><br><p>A perennial classic in the anthropology of food, Everyone Eats feeds our need to understand human ecology by explaining the ways that cultures and political systems structure the edible environment.</p></p><p><b>E. N. Anderson</b> is Professor of Anthropology at the University of California, Riverside.

(<i>The Bookwatch, The Midwest Book Review</i>)<br><br>"Anderson&#x2019;s book is a solid introduction to the anthropology of food for students and general readers. It is clear, well-written, spiced with interesting examples, and illustrated with many evocative photographs taken by the author and by Barbara Anderson." (<i>Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute</i>)<br><br>"Everyone Eats is anthropology at its best, an exceptional blend of biological and cultural explanation that reveals our relationship with food and eating. Anderson's personal ethnographic experience as a nutritional anthropologist among cultures from around the world will leave the reader with a sense of wonderment about the fundamental human act of eating. Throughout the book Anderson develops a deep social conscience about the problems of overand under-nutritionthat face the world today" (Barrett P.

God did not design the church to be a two-hour experience on Sunday but a mixture of people from all across the map and spectrum: men and women, rich and poor, Caucasians or African Americans, and Mexican Americans, Latin Americans, Asian Americans, and Indian Americans, and a mixture of people with varying personalities and tastes.&nbsp; The church McKnight grew up in was a fellowship of sames and likes. There was almost no variety in his church. White folks, same beliefs about everything, same tastes in music and worship and sermons and lifestyle.&nbsp; Because of his experience, he writes incisively and compellingly.</p><p>The church is <em>God&#x2019;s world-changing social experiment</em> of bringing unlikes and differents to the table to share life with one another as a new kind of family.&nbsp; When this happens we show to the world what love, justice, peace, reconciliation, and life together is designed by God to be. The church is God&#x2019;s show-and-tell for the world to see how God wants us to live as a family.</p></p><p><p>Scot McKnight (PhD, Nottingham) is the Julius R.

The staff of Transformation Church will be reading this phenomenal book. -- Derwin L. Gray, lead pastor of Transformation Church; author, Limitless Life<br><br>I love this book! It&#x2019;s the theological mac to my social-psychological cheese. The pursuit of unity in the midst of difference is a trek across a minefield. With each step, we must contend with challenges that threaten to send us running back to the &#x201c;safety&#x201d; of similar others. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m so thankful for A Fellowship of Differents. McKnight draws from Paul&#x2019;s letters to give readers the robust foundation and action steps needed to keep pursuing unity at all costs. -- Christena Cleveland, author Disunity in Christ; associate professor of reconciliation studies, Bethel University<br><br>For over twenty-five years I&#x2019;ve served as a church planter and pastor of churches that wrestled with being pots of stew (or &#x201c;salad bowls,&#x201d; as Scot McKnight would put it). Pastors in my situation found ourselves ---sometimes unwittingly --- in conflict with the so-called &#x201c;homogenous unit principle,&#x201d; that highly pragmatic perspective at work in megachurches whose explosive growth had many of us drooling and sitting at the feet of CEO-pastors. Yet I craved something else: a resource to encourage and challenge us from the Scriptures, affirming our work among people of various backgrounds, different races, ethnicities, genders, and economic groups. McKnight has blended his expertise in the NT and his passion as a life-long participant in the church to address just about every topic we can imagine! I enthusiastically recommend this book! -- Rev. Dennis R. Edwards, PhD, senior pastor of The Sanctuary Covenant Church in Minneapolis<br><br>Pour yourself a cup of coffee and settle into this timely, provocative, and challenging book on what it means to be the church. McKnight&#x2019;s conversational style and his perceptive insights to American Christian culture combine with his expert analysis of Scripture to illuminate God&#x2019;s design for Christian fellowship. An essential read for all who long for the church to live out its calling. -- Lynn Cohick, professor of New Testament, Wheaton College<br><br>A Fellowship of Differents echoes God&#x2019;s plea for true community: for the church to become the real deal embracing all of God&#x2019;s different kinds of people, to unite in a &#x201c;wild revolution of equality&#x201d; through Him, to bring visibility to the otherwise invisible. Most importantly, this book shows us how true unity is the only way to achieve Jesus&#x2019; heart for his bride, the church. -- Bruxy Cavey, author of bestseller The End of Religion; teaching pastor at The Meeting House<br><br>At a moment when so many are questioning what the church is and wondering if it even matters, McKnight&#x2019;s claim --- that the way we follow Jesus is shaped by our local church more than any other source --- is a bold, prophetic, and compelling idea. Reading this book gave me a new vision for what my church is and what it could be. It was nothing short of a love affair with Jesus&#x2019; bride all over again. -- John Mark Comer, Pastor of Teaching and Vision, Bridgetown: A Jesus Church<br><br>A Fellowship of Differents is an impressive achievement: it puts the church in conversation with today&#x2019;s most difficult differences and differents --- and the church comes out making sense. Scot McKnight&#x2019;s work is precisely in step with Jesus&#x2019; famous words: &#x201c;I will build my church.&#x201d; We need this book because all of us different people in the modern church are the ones Jesus has trusted with the keys to the kingdom! -- Anglican Bishop Todd Hunter, author, Giving Church Another Chance<br><br>Ever wonder what Paul would say to the Church today? This is it. Scot McKnight has captured the mind and heart of our beloved apostle, who spent his whole life pursuing one dream, preaching one gospel, sacrificing everything for one beautiful vision: that all people would believe in the Lord because the church --- this strange collection of humanity united by the miraculous work of the Holy Spirit for one purpose --- is the very body of Christ. -- Rodney Reeves, professor of biblical studies, Southwest Baptist University<br><br>One of my life values is that uniqueness is better than conformity, firmly believing (though I realize this is strong) that conformity only leads to death. My work with church leaders shows me that healthy thriving churches are not only places of diversity, but they love that about themselves. A Fellowship of Differents will feel like a commendation to churches who already live in this tension, and like a loving and prophetic intervention for those who wrongly worship the god of sameness. -- Mark Oestreicher, partner, The Youth Cartel; Author, Hopecasting<br><br>Scot McKnight applies a professor&#x2019;s mind with a pastor&#x2019;s heart to one of the greatest enemies of God&#x2019;s plan for his church: disunity. Instead of being a &#x201c;salad bowl&#x201d; fellowship of difference and differents, we&#x2019;ve segregated ourselves into homogeneous groups so remote that we are virtually invisible to each another. The author doesn&#x2019;t stop by describing this inconvenient truth, but identifies six themes of the Christian life that, when implemented in the church by God&#x2019;s grace, will help us to love one another and flourish as one people of God. No Christ-follower who cares about the beauty of Christ&#x2019;s bride, the church, should miss this masterful guide to creating a fellowship of differents! -- Dr. E Andrew McQuitty, senior pastor of Irving Bible Church, author of Notes from the Valley<br><br>The local church certainly has its failings and therefore, its critics. Most critics are just angry and few are helpful. Scot McKnight loves the local church and because he loves the local church, his words of criticism don&#x2019;t wound as much as they remind us &#x2013; of who we once were, of who we&#x2019;re called to be, and who we can yet become. Like a parent showing a child the child&#x2019;s baby picture, Scot McKnight, in his book, A Fellowship of Differents, calls us back to the original dreams of fellowship and transformational love Jesus first intended for us &#x2013; and still intends for us now. -- Mike Glenn, Senior Pastor, Brentwood Baptist Church, Brentwood, TN<br><br>In the context of a rapidly changing world, our ecclesiology must go deeper. In a winsome manner, Scot McKnight brings the teachings of the apostle Paul to life so that we may rediscover what the church is supposed to be. A Fellowship of Differents provides a hopeful and an applicable ecclesiology for the twenty-first century that provides insight into the burden and joy of being the church. -- Dr. Soong-Chan Rah, Milton B.

In <i>Inter/Nationalism, </i>Salaita argues that American Indian and Indigenous studies must be more central to the scholarship and activism focusing on Palestine.&nbsp;</p><p>Salaita offers a fascinating inside account of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement&#x2014;which, among other things, aims to end Israel&#x2019;s occupation of Palestinian land. In doing so, he emphasizes BDS&#x2019;s significant potential as an organizing entity as well as its importance in the creation of intellectual and political communities that put Natives and other colonized peoples such as Palestinians into conversation. His discussion includes readings of a wide range of Native poetry that invokes Palestine as a theme or symbol; the speeches of U.S. President Andrew Jackson and early Zionist thinker Ze&#x2019;ev Jabotinsky; and the discourses of &#x201c;shared values&#x201d; between the United States and Israel.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Inter/Nationalism </i>seeks to lay conceptual ground between American Indian and Indigenous studies and Palestinian studies through concepts of settler colonialism, indigeneity, and state violence. By establishing Palestine as an indigenous nation under colonial occupation, this book draws crucial connections between the scholarship and activism of Indigenous America and Palestine.</p></p><p><p>Steven Salaita is the author of several books, including <i>Uncivil Rites: Palestine and the Limits of Academic Freedom </i>and <i>Israel&#x2019;s Dead Soul. </i></p><p>"This is a powerful and moving analysis of what it means to decolonize settler societies through an unflinchingly ethical and incisively original notion of inter/nationalism. Steven Salaita is, as always, bold, brilliant, and visionary. <i>Inter/Nationalism </i>offers a searing, comparative analysis of what liberation means in North America and Palestine-Israel. It is a must read for academics, activists, and anyone interested in challenging the logics of ethnic cleansing and settler civility."&#x2014;Sunaina Maira, University of California, Davis</p><p>"Steven Salaita grounds his analysis within various literatures, histories, and political movements in order to consider the ongoing, transnational circuits of liberalism and empire in the politics of critique, aspiration, and solidarity. Much to Salaita&#x2019;s credit, his cases do not lose their specificity and their nuance as he considers specific efforts for land, global justice, and dignity. This is a welcome work of criticism and analysis from a truly transnational scholar of Indigenous politics and literature."&#x2014;Audra Simpson, Columbia University</p><p>"Although often specific in its geographical articulation, settler-colonialism is a global phenomena that requires a truly global response. This is the message powerfully hammered home in Steve Salaita's crucially important <i>Inter/Nationalism</i>. Building on years of research and activism in support of Native American and Palestinian self-determination, Salaita advances a radically transnational view of decolonization grounded in a richly comparative account of Native American/Indigenous solidarity and our mutual struggles for land, freedom, and dignity."&#x2014;Glen Coulthard, author of <i>Red Skin, White Masks: Rejecting the Colonial Politics of Recognition</i></p><br><br><p>"Steven Salaita engages multiple layers of history, theory, and politics."&#x2014;<i>Indian Country Media Network</i></p><p>"Simultaneously a worthwhile contribution to academic theory and a powerful articulation of the potentialities of inter/national solidarity. This is a notable feat at a moment where anti-intellectualism and progressive despair threaten to overwhelm, but Salaita&#x2019;s work here ought serve as a hopeful reminder of the ongoing and truly global resistance."&#x2014;<i>Hong Kong Review of Books</i></p><p>"The book is not only a brilliant study, it is also a needed incitement."&#x2014;<i>Journal of Palestine Studies</i></p><p>"This is a thought-provoking book on comparative settler-colonial ideology and a persuasive plea for greater cooperation between American Indian and Palestine Studies."&#x2014;<i>Ethnic and Racial Studies</i></p></p><h2>The Land of the Bible: A Historical Geography, Revised and Enlarged Edition</h2><p><p>Since its first publication in this country, Yohanan Aharoni's informative, fact-filled work has been a prime source in its field.

And Mas, busy tending lawns, gambling, and struggling to put his Hiroshima past behind him, never had much time for the family he was trying to support. For years now, his resentful daughter has lived a continent away in New York City, and had a life he knew little about. But an anxious phone call from Mari asking for his help plunges the usually obstinate Mas into a series of startling situations from maneuvering in an unfamiliar city to making nice with his tall, blond son-in-law, Lloyd, to taking care of a sickly child...to finding a dead body in the rubble of a former koi pond. <br><br>The victim was Kazzy Ouchi, a half-Japanese millionaire who also happened to be Mari and Lloyd&#x2019;s boss. Stumbling onto the scene, Mas sees more amiss than the detectives do, but his instinct is to keep his mouth shut. Only when the case threatens his daughter and her family does Mas take action: patiently, stubbornly tugging at the end of a tangled, dangerous mystery. And as he does, he begins to lay bare a tragic secret on the dark side of an American dream....<br><br>Both a riveting mystery and a powerful story of passionate relationships across a cultural divide,<b> Gasa-Gasa Girl</b> is a tale told with heart and wisdom: an unforgettable portrait of fathers, daughters, and other strangers.</p><p>Naomi Hirahara is a freelance writer and journalist who served for several years as an editor of <i>The Rafu Shimpo</i>, the largest Japanese American daily newspaper.

Even in the best neighborhoods in Beverly Hills or San Marino back in Southern California, lawns lay open like luxurious carpets to the edges of sidewalks, beckoning guests and the glances of envious passersby. Of course, back home there were also visual threats and warnings&#x2013;the blue and yellow Armed Response signs on metal stakes. But it was one thing to pierce grass with a sign, and quite another to put a garden behind bars.<br><br>"It's called a community garden," Tug Yamada explained. "Everyone pitches in to make it green." <br><br>They were stuck in traffic on Flatbush Avenue. Tug had picked Mas up in a white Mercury rental car, a pearl amid the black Town Cars that had circled JFK Airport. Mas could always count on Tug to help him in a pinch. But then again, Mas guessed that Tug was behind this recent turn of events. It would take an outside force&#x2013;specifically a six-foot Nisei, a second-generation Japanese American&#x2013;to push Mas's daughter, Mari, to place a call from Brooklyn to his home in Altadena.<br><br>"Community? Like Japanese ones back in Los Angeles?"<br><br>"No Japanese gardeners over here, Mas. At least no more than you can count on one hand." Tug stretched out his palm, magnifying the missing half of his forefinger, a remnant of his war injury in Europe.<br><br>This was no place for Japanese gardeners and no place for a Kibei like Mas, who was born in the U.S. but raised in Japan. Kibei&#x2013;"ki" meaning "return," "bei" referring to America&#x2013;was a word made up by Japanese Americans to explain their limbo. So while America was actually home for the Kibei, many of them weren't quite comfortable with English; on the other hand, they weren't that comfortable speaking Japanese, either.<br><br>Mas was used to not belonging, but he felt an especially strong sense of displacement the minute he'd gotten on the plane. A bunch of hakujin and blacks, and a few young Chinese. There were a couple of Japanese, but they were business types who wore blue and black suits with ties and hard shoes even on the airplane. They sat in the front, behind a curtain that separated the first class from the rest of the plane, called economy but really meaning bimbo, for the passengers with no money, like Mas. Even when Mas returned to America from Hiroshima in 1947, he bought the third-class boat tickets, which turned out to be a large open room full of other teenage dreamers lying on goza, straw mats, on the bottom of the ship.<br><br>In the streets of New York, there were black and brown teenagers with the same look in their eyes. Wrapped in puffy jackets and their heads topped with knit caps, they seemed to hold their dreams casually, maybe recklessly, as if those dreams could never dry up.<br><br>"Everyone gasa-gasa ova here, huh?"<br><br>"Yeah, everyone moves around in New York, Mas. You should see where Joy lives in Manhattan. It's like rivers of people walking at night."<br><br>Tug had been in New York for a couple of weeks now before the opening of his daughter Joy's art exhibit. In Mas's eyes, Tug was the closest thing to an expert on Manhattan. "Joy live close to ova here?"<br><br>"You have to go over the Brooklyn Bridge, but it's just a short subway ride away."<br><br>"Fancy place, dis Manhattan?"<br><br>"Well, Joy lives in a postage stamp of an apartment. The water comes out all brown." Tug stroked his white beard. "And you know how I love baths, Mas."<br><br>Tug, in fact, had installed a Jacuzzi tub, his and his wife Lil's only extravagance, in their modest home just two miles east of Mas's. There was no doubt that this love for baths started when Tug was a child simmering nightly in the family furo, the huge Japanese wooden tub, on their red chili pepper farm.<br><br>Mas asked a few more perfunctory questions about Joy, then cut to the chase. "So you knowsu whatsu goin' on with Mari?"<br><br>"I'd better let her and Lloyd explain."<br><br>Lloyd? Mas had barely thought of his new son-in-law. "Not the baby&#x2013;?" Mas couldn't even say the name: Takeo Frederick Jensen. It was too long; and why had they named the child Takeo, anyhow?<br><br>Mari had sent a photo back in December of a little red monkey-faced infant with fists curled up like cooked shrimp. You couldn't tell if the baby looked more Japanese or hakujin or something in between. Mas remembered when Mari had been that small. He was almost afraid to touch her, and even Chizuko told him to keep his distance. But, in time, he got the hang of it&#x2013;support the neck, watch the soft spot on top of the head. The first and only time he gave Mari a bath, he noticed a dark-blue mark above her buttocks and thought he had done something wrong. "Masao-san, most Japanese babies have that," Chizuko said, laughing. Later Tug's wife, Lil, explained that doctors called it a Mongolian spot, which seemed like a fancy term for a temporary birthmark on a baby's behind.<br><br>Tug stopped the car at another light, and Mas noticed another one of the community gardens. This one was a triangle of green trapped next to a fancy white store that looked like it sold overpriced basketball shoes and jerseys. Mas could make out a Japanese cedar, and even some kind of makeshift pond. It was still cold in New York, a good thirty degrees lower than L.A. Were the people of New York City so hungry for trees and flowers that they had to create this spring oasis in the middle of melting snow?<br><br>Tug seemed to read Mas's mind. "Lloyd was telling me about that place. Even has a name, Teddy Bear Garden, or something like that."<br><br>Teddy bear? Kids' stuff, thought Mas.<br><br>"A developer was going to get rid of the garden, so the whole community, even Lloyd and Mari, protested. Early on, somebody had thrown a teddy bear into the area, so I guess the name stuck. You know about these community gardens, Mas. There's one across the freeway from Dodger Stadium, I think."<br><br>Tug was a die-hard Dodger fan, so it was no wonder that anything remotely involving his baseball team would stick in his mind. Mas himself recollected seeing the small clumps of flowers and vegetables against a hill right above one of the tunnels of the Pasadena Freeway. And there was another garden in Alhambra, a few towns south of Altadena, where Chinese immigrants dressed in cotton pants and sometimes straw hats tended stalks of corn and vines of cherry tomatoes. But those gardens were primarily vegetables, while these ones on Flatbush Avenue were filled with trees and flowers struggling to bloom. In L.A., everybody had pride of ownership in their personal flower gardens&#x2013;a concept that had led Mas and several thousands of other Japanese Americans to get jobs as gardeners, whether they could actually grow anything or not. Everyone assumed that Japanese had green thumbs. If only they knew the truth: that most of them starting out could hardly tell the difference between a weed and an impatiens plant. But they had caught on fast enough, making money to feed their families and send their kids to fancy schools as far away as New York.<br><br>"How long youzu gonna stay?" Mas asked.<br><br>"Well, Joy's exhibition opens in a couple of weeks. You, Mari, and Lloyd are all invited, you know. I don't know about the baby, though. I don't know what people do at art gallery openings."<br><br>Tug's daughter, Joy, had recently traded in her white coat and stethoscope for poverty and paintbrushes. It had been a bad blow, but in typical Yamada fashion, Tug had bounced back, in full support of his daughter's new career. Mas had never been much into support; at least that's what both Chizuko and Mari told him time and time again. That's why he had been surprised to hear Mari's quavering voice on the other end of the line from Brooklyn: "We're in a bit of trouble, Dad. We might need your help." Help? When had Mari ever asked for help? Mari didn't want to get into the details but told him that she and her new husband, Lloyd, were going to buy him an airplane ticket. "You'll need a driver's license to board. And don't forget a credit card, just in case," she said.<br><br>But there was one problem: Mas didn't have a credit card. He'd had one briefly, when his wife, Chizuko, was alive, but that had been about fifteen years ago. So he went to the bank, and within a week, he had his own shiny piece of plastic bearing on it his full name, masao arai.<br><br>Now, with his driver's license and new credit card in his worn leather wallet, he had both an identity and money. He wasn't sure whether they were enough to help Mari, but he knew if he didn't come through this time, he probably would never get the chance again.<br>They passed a few more corner pizza shops, a line of leafless trees in a brown park, and some small grocery stores that looked like the old produce stands in Little Tokyo. Tug finally turned right onto a smaller avenue called Carlton. On both sides of the street were three-story brick buildings&#x2013;brownstones, Tug had called them. They all had heavy metal gates on the doors, but no Armed Response signs. These Brooklyn people chose to fight their crime the old-fashioned way, thought Mas.<br><br>Cars were parked bumper to bumper along the curb, so Tug double-parked in front of one of the brownstones, pressing down a button to open the trunk. "I'm sorry I can't wait with you," Tug said. <br><br>He left the car running while he got out and lifted Mas's hard plastic yellow Samsonite suitcase from the trunk. Mas clenched his arthritic hands as he waited out on the curb in the cold.<br><br>Tug handed Mas the suitcase and a set of keys. "Lloyd asked me to give these to you. One's for the gate and the other's for the door. He'll come home right after work."<br><br>And Mari, what about her? Before Mas could get any more information, Tug was back at the driver's-side door. "See you, old man. I'll call you tomorrow."<br><br>Mas hesitated for a moment in front of the brownstone. Clutching his suitcase and keys, he started up the concrete steps, only to have Tug honk his car horn. Shaking his head of white hair back and forth, Tug lowered the passenger's-side window. "No, Mas," he said, "not up there. Down."<br><br>Mas pointed to a gate on the right that seemed to submerge below street level, and Tug nodded in response. With that, the white rental disappeared down Carlton Avenue, leaving only a brief trail of steam and exhaust.<br><br>This was worse than Mas had imagined. He knew making ends meet for a freelance filmmaker and&#x2013;could he even say it&#x2013;modern-day gardener in New York must be tough, but was it tough enough that they had to live underground? Even the small window, no higher than Mas's knees from the street, was heavily barred. You couldn't tell if it was meant to keep people out or keep people in.<br><br>Trying the keys a couple of times, Mas was finally able to open the gate. Beyond the gate was a dark and damp entryway leading to a large door. Mas's eyes had trouble adjusting to the dim light, so he pulled out his new Rite Aid reading glasses from his shirt pocket to pick out the key for the door.<br><br>The apartment was cool and musty, much like his garage after a winter rain. There were layers of smells: the familiar staleness of old newspapers and books, a lingering memory of meals made by Mari and Lloyd, and maybe decades of households before them, and a faint sweetness of talcum powder. Mas felt the side of the wall by the door&#x2013;wood paneling, but no light switch. He could make out the outline of a lamp shade, found the knob, and turned it two times.<br><br>The front room was small, about fifteen feet by fifteen feet. There was a long couch along the wall on the left side, but what caught Mas's eye first was a set of wooden stairs that led not to a door or room but to another wall. Stairs that went nowhere, an underground apartment&#x2013;what was this house? Tug had explained that the neighborhood was called Park Slope, but Mas hadn't seen any sign of anything green other than the Teddy Bear Garden. He noticed that unlike in typical Japanese American households, no shoes were left anywhere near the doorway, so he went ahead and stepped onto the hardwood floors, leaving his suitcase on the threadbare brown rug.<br><br>There was a mini kitchen in the corner, a wire dish rack holding a couple of coffee cups, a plate, and a few upside-down baby bottles. A desk by the hollow fireplace was overburdened by papers and books&#x2013;it seemed almost as if it were spitting out and rejecting the weight of the information it carried. Mas turned on another lamp by the desk and peered at the books. Most were in English, but a couple were in Japanese. A Japanese-English dictionary, the fat kind that Chizuko had used when she was writing official letters, sat on a shelf. Even though Mas and Chizuko had sent their daughter to Japanese school every Saturday, Mari wouldn't have anything to do with the language and had forgotten the little that she had learned. Chizuko was offended and sometimes hurt when the teenage Mari had hissed at her in public places: "Speak English, Mom, speak English."<br><br>These couldn't be Mari's books: but then again, who else's would they be? The son-in-law's?<br><br>On the shelf next to the dictionary were a couple of photographs: the same one of the baby Takeo that Mari had sent to Mas, and a large one of Mari with her pale and scraggly husband, Lloyd, standing on some cement stairs leading to an official government building. Mas had not seen Lloyd for years, and that absence hadn't done Lloyd any good. Instead of looking more refined and clean-cut, his hair was down to his shoulders and barely combed. He wore wire-rimmed glasses and a tan suit, but he wasn't fooling anyone. He was a no-good gardener, just like Mas. But while Mas was a Kibei, Lloyd was a hakujin man, over six feet tall. He had absolutely no excuse for falling into the same line of work as desperate men.<br><br>Taped to the wall over the desk was a grainy photocopy of a man's image. Mas adjusted his Rite Aid glasses. A Japanese man wearing a straw hat and suit. A shadow fell on half the man's face, but he looked important. Erai: a big-boss type. The image was black-and-white and had obviously been taken more than half a century ago, maybe in the 1920s or 1930s, about the time Mas was born.</p><h2>The Food of New Orleans: Authentic Recipes from the Big Easy [Cajun &amp; Creole Cookbook, Over 80 Recipes] (Food Of The World Cookbooks)</h2><p><b>This comprehensive Cajun and Creole cookbook presents over seventy recipes from all the top New Orleans restaurants.</b> <br><br>From Brennan's and Emeril to Commanders Palace&#x2014;providing all the heady Cajun and Creole flavors of this fabulous food city in one handy volume.

Pollio), Roman architect and engineer, studied Greek philosophy and science and gained experience in the course of professional work. He was one of those appointed to be overseers of imperial artillery or military engines, and was architect of at least one unit of buildings for Augustus in the reconstruction of Rome. Late in life and in ill health he completed, sometime before 27 BCE, <i>De Architectura</i> which, after its rediscovery in the fifteenth century, was influential enough to be studied by architects from the early Renaissance to recent times.</p><p>In <i>On Architecture</i> Vitruvius adds to the tradition of Greek theory and practice the results of his own experience.

Drawing on her own published and unpublished writing, Carolyn Steedman has produced a sustained argument about the way in which history writing belongs to the currents of thought shaping the modern world.</p><p>Steedman begins by asserting that in recent years much attention has been paid to the archive by those working in the humanities and social sciences; she calls this practice "archivization." By definition, the archive is the repository of "that which will not go away," and the book goes on to suggest that, just like dust, the "matter of history" can never go away or be erased.</p><p>This unique work will be welcomed by all historians who want to think about what it is they do.</p></p><p>Carolyn Steedman is professor of history at the University of Warwick (United Kingdom).</p><h2>Ancient Egypt and the Old Testament</h2><p>An enlightening guide to Egyptian influences on Israelite history. Includes illustrations.</p><p>In 1872 August Eisenlohr observed, &#39;It has long been the object of Egyptologists to discover in the numerous Egyptian monuments still remaining in stone and papyrus, traces of the Israelites, which might show us the events related in the Old Testament from an Egyptian point of view.&#39; Much has changed since Eisenlohr uttered those words. Many scholars today maintain a less judicious approach, arguing that there was little contact between Egypt and the Bible.This volume will argue vigorously against that prevailing minimalistic approach. The reality is that we do not give the biblical writers enough credit for their knowledge of the ancient Near East and of Egypt in particular. A primary aim of this book is to show many firm point of contact between Egypt and the Bible on a variety of levels.John D. Currid (PhD, Oriental Institute, University of Chicago) is Carl W.

Unfortunately, however, during one such conversation, one man spots a gold Rolex watch on a TV soap opera&#x2019;s goatherd. This seemingly small absurdity sets off alarms: strange sensations of deception, distress, and incipient madness. The two men&#x2019;s uneasiness soon becomes a nightmare as the TV adventure advances with a real-life plot &#x2015; involving a mutant strain of killer algae &#x2015; to take over the world! <em>The Conversations</em>, a reality within a fiction within a parallel reality, is hilariously funny and surprisingly touching.</p><p><p>Nominated for a Neustadt award and the Man Booker International Prize, <strong>C�sar Aira</strong> was born in Coronel Pringles, Argentina, in 1949.

Later, at his leisure, recalling the meandering rhythms of the talks, the narrator reconsiders the circularity of their conversations. He ponders how conversations and memories of conversations overlap with other memories to form a stream of consciousness that erases the boundaries between the individual&#x2019;s thoughts and those of others, a kind of echoing of talk and thoughts, so that, ultimately, it&#x2019;s not clear who said what, whose position has subtly shifted over time, and how sensibilities have blended. The narrator and his friend ponder the incongruities in movies and in life. &#x201c;The impetus to speak and to remember what was spoken, though the same, were charged with distinct and incompatible energies,&#x201d; he observes in this at times hilarious social commentary on the inanities of modern life and the significance of conversation. --Vanessa Bush</p><h2>The Miracle of the Breath: Mastering Fear, Healing Illness, and Experiencing the Divine</h2><p>&#34;Take a deep breath.&#34; &#34;Just breathe.&#34; Common calming mantras, but what do they really mean?

Apart from the famous <i>War Poems</i> of 1919, which firmly established his reputation, he published eight volumes of verse during his lifetime.

It was first published in 1947 and subsequently enlarged to include the late poems in <i>Sequences</i>.<br></p><p>The celebrated British poet, editor, critic, novelist, and diarist <b>Siegfried Sassoon</b> (1886-1967) enlisted for military service on the first day of World War I; his friends in the service included Robert Graves and Wilfred Owen.

After the war, he went on to write several other books of poetry and criticism, as well as six volumes of prose autobiography."For his generation, the poetry and career of Siegfried Sassoon were emblematic of the ways in which the secure truths of Western civilization were destroyed in the hopeless foxholes of the First World War.

The first book to delineate and assess the complexity of Mexican-Anglo interaction in south Texas, it also shows how Tejanos continued to play a leading role in the commercialization of ranching after 1848 and how they maintained a sense of community. Despite shifts in jurisdiction, the tradition of Tejano land holding acted as a stabilizing element and formed an important part of Tejano history and identity. The earliest settlers arrived in the 1730s and established numerous ranchos and six towns along the river. Through a careful study of land and tax records, brands and bills of sale of livestock, wills, population and agricultural censuses, and oral histories, Alonzo shows how Tejanos adapted to change and maintained control of their <i>ranchos</i> through the 1880s, when Anglo encroachment and changing social and economic conditions eroded most of the community's land base.</p></p><p>A revisionist account of the Tejano experience in south Texas from its Spanish colonial roots to 1900.Professor Armando Alonzo is a borderlands scholar in the History department at Texas A&amp;M University.</p><h2>Big Day Coming: Yo La Tengo and the Rise of Indie Rock</h2><p><b>The first biography of Yo La Tengo, the massively influential band who all but defined indie music. <br><br></b><p></p><p>Yo La Tengo has lit up the indie scene for three decades, part of an underground revolution that defied corporate music conglomerates, eschewed pop radio, and found a third way.

This imposing, fabulous complex is made up of a hotel, residences, restaurants, offices, shops, and more. It is a haven for the famous after they break out and, on occasion, for the infamous when they break in. Its very name has become part of our history. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret Truman, herself the bearer of one of the world's most famous names, knows Washington's ins and outs, including who is "in" and who is "out." In this absorbing, timely Capital Crimes mystery, she shows us around this fascinating city that is America's center of power and--some would say--corruption. Some of those who are "out" here are very dead indeed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The glittering cast of characters includes Vice President Joe Aprile, who plans to become president, if he can avoid a tempting vice; a glamorous Washington hostess and fund-raiser, Elfie Dorrance, with a propensity for marrying rich and powerful men and then grieving prettily at the end--their end; and Chris Hedras, a special assistant to the vice president, with some very special ambitions. And, of course, Annabel Smith, gallery owner, and Mac Smith, law school professor. The story deals in part with the influence on political campaigns of "soft money" and its hard consequences, as well as this country's tortuous and often ambiguous relationship with Mexico, in particular the glorious San Miguel de Allende, home of the well-to-do, and a few ill-to-do, a place involving drugs, politics, and police and politicians looking the other way.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again Margaret Truman offers a delight to the reader who likes a fast-turning page, the pleasure of inside information, the allure of high life crossing paths with lowlife, and the return of the attractive crime-solving couple Mac and Annabel</p><p>One wonders what will happen if and when Margaret Truman runs out of "appropriate" Washington, D.C., landmarks in and around which to stage her murders. <i>Murder at the Watergate</i> fits nicely into the mold with which Truman's fans have long been familiar: that elegant couple, Mac Smith and Annabel Reed, newly ensconced in their Watergate apartment, become enmeshed in a political imbroglio that leads--as it must--to murder. Their good friend, the vice president, finds that U.S. policy on Mexico can be one hot potato. Or tamale. The dueling factions of the Mexican-American Trade Alliance and the Mexico initiative--the former an "unoffical" but deeply menacing lobbying presence with a stake in maintaining the status quo, the latter a think tank bent on exposing corruption deep within Mexico's ruling party--weave a ragged tapestry of blackmail, bribery, assault, and murder that threatens to envelop both Mac and Annabel--and the administration itself. Truman hopscotches rather frantically around the globe and throws in a few over-the-top minor characters to keep the loyal reader hot on her trail. A less devoted reader may be tempted to abandon the chase somewhere in London.<p> One doesn't read Truman for her dialogue, her characters, or her gripping cliffhangers. But her cogent meditations and snide asides on politicking and politicos are absolutely on target and a pleasure to read. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>The never-ending fascination with our nation's capital has made Margaret Truman's novels bestsellers everywhere, including in my territory in Southern California.

But, in the great texts of that discourse, these writers downplayed a crucial requirement for capitalism&#x2019;s creation: For it to succeed, peasants would have to abandon their self-sufficient lifestyle and go to work for wages in a factory. Why would they willingly do this?<br> Clearly, they did not go willingly. As Michael Perelman shows, they were forced into the factories with the active support of the same economists who were making theoretical claims for capitalism as a self-correcting mechanism that thrived without needing government intervention. Directly contradicting the laissez-faire principles they claimed to espouse, these men advocated government policies that deprived the peasantry of the means for self-provision in order to coerce these small farmers into wage labor. To show how Adam Smith and the other classical economists appear to have deliberately obscured the nature of the control of labor and how policies attacking the economic independence of the rural peasantry were essentially conceived to foster primitive accumulation, Perelman examines diaries, letters, and the more practical writings of the classical economists. He argues that these private and practical writings reveal the real intentions and goals of classical political economy&#x2014;to separate a rural peasantry from their access to land.<br> This rereading of the history of classical political economy sheds important light on the rise of capitalism to its present state of world dominance. Historians of political economy and Marxist thought will find that this book broadens their understanding of how capitalism took hold in the industrial age.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p><br><b><br></b></p></p><p>&#x201c;This study is to be admired for its comprehensiveness, scope, and the amount of unearthing and excavation Perelman provides.

The comparison doesn't accurately describe Morgan's second novel, <i>Broken Angels</i>. Morgan's prose never approaches Chandler's metaphoric excess, and Morgan's antihero, Takeshi Kovacs, doesn't wisecrack nearly as often as Chandler's hero, Philip Marlowe. Also, Kovacs's far-future universe is considerably darker than Marlowe's noir world. In Kovacs's universe, high-tech implants called "stacks" record memory and personality; this means soldiers can be sent to their deaths, have their stacks implanted in new bodies, and be sent to their deaths again, and again, and again. Generals needn't quibble about wasting lives in massacres or nuclear explosions. The slaughtered soldiers will soon be back in action--unless their stacks aren't recovered. Then their consciousness will go mad, isolated in an indestructible, inescapable virtual reality. The proper term for the Takeshi Kovacs novels isn't "hardboiled." It's "brutal."<p> The Martians disappeared long ago, but they left behind their star gates, which have allowed humanity to spread across the galaxy--and bring warfare to the stars. As <i>Broken Angels</i> opens, Takeshi Kovacs is a lieutenant in humankind's most feared mercenary company, but rumors of an astonishing archaelogical discovery inspire his desertion. Humans have never found a Martian starship until, perhaps, now. If the rumors are true, and the ruthless Kovacs can take possession of the unprecedented relic, he will make his fortune. But if he fails in his quest, he may find himself imprisoned in high-tech hell for eternity. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p>"Welcome back to the brash, brutal new world of the twenty-fifth century: where global politics isn't just for planet Earth anymore; and where death is just a break in the action, thanks to the techno-miracle that can preserve human consciousness and download it into one new body after another. <br>Cynical, quick-on-the-trigger Takeshi Kovacs, the ex-U.N. envoy turned private eye, has changed careers, and bodies, once more . . . trading sleuthing for soldiering as a warrior-for-hire, and helping a far-flung planet's government put down a bloody revolution. <br>But when it comes to taking sides, the only one Kovacs is ever really on is his own. So when a rogue pilot and a sleazy corporate fat cat offer him a lucrative role in a treacherous treasure hunt, he's only too happy to go AWOL with a band of resurrected soldiers of fortune. All that stands between them and the ancient alien spacecraft they mean to salvage are a massacred city bathed in deadly radiation, unleashed nanotechnolgy with a million ways to kill, and whatever surprises the highly advanced Martian race may have in store.

But, as professor Patricia Roberts-Miller explains, a demagogue is <i>anyone </i>who reduces all questions to <i>us </i>vs. <i>them</i>.<br><br><b>Why is it dangerous? </b>Demagoguery is democracy&#x2019;s greatest threat. It erodes rational debate, so that intelligent policymaking grinds to a halt. The idea that <i>we </i>never fall for it&#x2014;that all the blame lies with <i>them</i>&#x2014;is equally dangerous.<br><br><b>How can we stop it? </b>Demagogues follow predictable patterns in what they say and do to gain power. The key to resisting demagoguery is to name it when you see it&#x2014;and to know where it leads.</p><p><b>Patricia Roberts-Miller, PhD,</b> is a Professor of Rhetoric and Writing at the University of Texas at Austin.&nbsp;She is the author of <i>Fanatical Schemes: Proslavery Rhetoric and the Tragedy of Consensus</i>,<i> Voices in the Wilderness: Public Discourse and the Paradox of Puritan Rhetoric</i>,<i>&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Deliberate Conflict: Argument, Political Theory, and Composition Classes.</i>&#x201c;An important book. . . designed to teach us&#x2014;all of us&#x2014;to be better citizens by learning to be better deliberators. . . . It has the potential to make our democracy (and maybe any democracy?) stronger and deliberatively healthier.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b><i>H-Rhetor</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;This book raises timely, relevant questions about how we talk to each other as it explores the ways demagogues promise stability and certainty by scapegoating and punishing an out-group for society&#x2019;s ills.&#x201d;<i><b>&#x2014;Maryland Today</b></i><br><br> &#x201c;If you are looking for a book to hand to those friends who are never wrong, always certain, often disdainful of others, and convinced that their arguments are irrefutable, then this is the book for you.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Martin J. Medhurst</b>, Distinguished Professor of Rhetoric and Communication, Baylor University<br><br> &#x201c;In&nbsp;<i>Demagoguery and Democracy</i>, Patricia Roberts-Miller does for demagoguery what Hannah Arendt did for evil in&nbsp;<i>Eichmann in Jerusalem</i>. She takes a familiar concept that seems straightforward and obviously detestable, and she challenges her readers to understand it for its complexity, and more importantly, to see how connected we all are to it.&nbsp;<i>Demagoguery and Democracy</i>&nbsp;is one of those rare books that is simultaneously approachable and complex, timely and timeless, and absolutely indispensable for understanding not just how to confront demagoguery, but also how to strengthen democracy.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Ryan Skinnell</b>, Assistant Professor of Rhetoric and Writing at San Jos� State University, and author of&nbsp;<i>Conceding Composition: A Crooked History of Composition&#x2019;s Institutional Fortunes</i><br><br> &#x201c;Roberts-Miller writes clearly, economically, and usefully so that we might recognize demagoguery for what it is&#x2014;a discourse that depoliticizes politics&#x2014;and start making our arguments more democratic, which is to say inclusive and fair instead of demonizing and menacing. Admittedly, demonizing is the easier option, but this small book makes a large case for deliberating instead.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Robert L. Ivie</b>, Professor Emeritus in English (Rhetoric) and American Studies, Indiana University, Bloomington<br><br> &#x201c;A timely guide for all who care about the quality&nbsp;and character&nbsp;of our democracy&#x2014;from professors of rhetoric to family members at the Thanksgiving table.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Janet M. Atwill</b>,&nbsp;Professor of Rhetoric,&nbsp;University of Tennessee<br><br> &#x201c;Everything we know about demagoguery is wrong, and misinformation can be fatal for democracy. Fortunately, Patricia Roberts-Miller&#x2019;s concise and insightful guide to the rhetoric of dangerous populism is the antidote. Using accessible examples&#x2014;everything from squirrels to former Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren&#x2014;and clear language, Roberts-Miller points the way toward a compassionate public discourse that rests on principle. Prepare to be made uncomfortable, though; we have met the demagogue, and sometimes, it is us.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Kel Munger, </b>journalist and book critic</p><h2>1947: Where Now Begins</h2><p><b><b>An NPR Best Book of the Year 2018<br><br>&#x201c;One of the best books, certainly the best nonfiction book, that I've read recently.&#x201d; &#x2014;Nancy Pearl on NPR&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Morning Edition&nbsp;</i></b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>&#x201c;An extraordinary achievement.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;<i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br>An award-winning writer captures a year that defined the modern world, intertwining historical events around the globe with key moments from her personal history.</b><br><br>The year 1947 marks a turning point in the twentieth century.

Beginning with the premise that the attack must be taken seriously, Eric Havelock shows that Plato&#x2019;s hostility is explained by the continued domination of the poetic tradition in contemporary Greek thought.</p><p>The reason for the dominance of this tradition was technological. In a nonliterate culture, stored experience necessary to cultural stability had to be preserved as poetry in order to be memorized. Plato attacks poets, particularly Homer, as the sole source of Greek moral and technical instruction&#x2015;Mr. Havelock shows how the <i>Iliad</i> acted as an oral encyclopedia. Under the label of mimesis, Plato condemns the poetic process of emotional identification and the necessity of presenting content as a series of specific images in a continued narrative.</p><p>The second part of the book discusses the Platonic Forms as an aspect of an increasingly rational culture. Literate Greece demanded, instead of poetic discourse, a vocabulary and a sentence structure both abstract and explicit in which experience could be described normatively and analytically: in short a language of ethics and science.</p></p><p>Eric A. Havelock was Sterling Professor of Classics, Emeritus, at Yale University.&#x201c;This book makes a major contribution...will offer the reader many hours of stimulating thought and a powerful challenge to reexamine some basic assumptions about the early Greek mind.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>The Classical Bulletin</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The frontiers of several fields of research meet in this rich and germinal study. Professor Havelock is concerned with Greek epic poetry and Plato&#x2019;s attack on it, with the whole of the Greek <i>paideia</i> as it existed before and after Plato, with the technological problems of communication, and, finally, with the emergence of Plato&#x2019;s doctrine of &#x2018;forms,&#x2019; in its total cultural setting... In brief, Havelock&#x2019;s point is that Plato&#x2019;s attack on poetry is integral to his philosophy as such if we see poetry as what it really was in his day... Havelock&#x2019;s thesis is a sweeping one, and, on the whole, utterly convincing, tying in with the findings of an increasing number of recent psychological, historical, philosophical, and cultural studies.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Walter J.

It is not too cold; the June days have heated the&nbsp;river, and the water has held the warmth all night. I flop onto my&nbsp;back and push away from the bank with my toes. My underclothes&nbsp;bloom like seedpods. Rose stands at the water&#x2019;s edge, guarding my&nbsp;dress and boots, the swamp stretching behind her. Her &nbsp;eyes are&nbsp;fixed to where I loll in the murky river; she is making sure, I suppose,&nbsp;that I am not about to slip from her life as I so often threaten to do.<br>I look toward the swamp, then spin on my back so I can see&nbsp;our house, a few fields off. While I float on the water, the village of&nbsp;Tigoora stirs much the same as it does every day. In our house&nbsp;Daddy puts on his jacket and thinks, maybe, about his time on the&nbsp;shivering ocean waves. The baronet and his lady snooze on, no&nbsp;doubt, knowing that the live-ins toil already and the rest of us will&nbsp;arrive shortly. Light &nbsp;seeps upward, diluting &nbsp;the ashen sky. The&nbsp;small ferryboat rocks, waiting to take us across the river to the Big&nbsp;House to begin our work.<br> &#x201c;Ada, &nbsp;get &nbsp;out &nbsp;now,&#x201d; &nbsp;Rose &nbsp;calls. &#x201c;I &nbsp;can &nbsp;see the &nbsp;ferryman coming. And Daddy, too. He told you not to go in the river.&#x201d;<br>I wave to Rose and swim a few strokes on my back. My sister&nbsp;looks like she might weep, so I haul myself out and pull my dress over my soaked underthings. The cloth drags against my wet skin, and Rose tugs at my sleeves and skirt to fix them. I wipe mud from my feet with wads of grass and pull on my stockings and boots.<br> &#x201c;Look at your hair,&#x201d; Rose says forlornly, catching the rope of it and squeezing out drops.<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be hidden under my cap,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t fret, Rose.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Once more you stink of the Liffey, Ada.&#x201d; Mrs. Rathcliffe, the housekeeper, watches while I put on my apron. &#x201c;And your hair is a shambles. I told your father to warn you not to arrive in that state to this house. Did he speak to you?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;He did, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d; &#x201c;And?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;And I won&#x2019;t do it again, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I cannot have you traipsing through the place like a muddy rat.&#x201d; Cook joins us in the stillroom. &#x201c;Lady Elizabeth &nbsp;is coming down this morning to do the menus. You&#x2019;ll need to get <i>her </i>out of&nbsp;here.&#x201d; Cook tosses her head in my direction.<br> Mrs. Rathcliffe looks at me, and I am chastened by her stern face. &#x201c;Ada, from today you will join your sister in the scullery.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;And you will not converse with each other. If I hear one speck of chatter or, God forbid, laughter from the scullery, I will be very, very cross. There will be consequences. Do you understand?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I do.&#x201d;<br> I leave the stillroom and stand in the passageway. The scullery, I think. I have had my warnings, but I am taken aback. I am dil- igent in my duties in this house, and the scullery is a step down.<br>They mean me to go backward through this life, it seems. What&nbsp;will the other girls say? And Mammy? Cook and Mrs. Rathcliffe continue to speak, thinking, I suppose, that I am already en- sconced with Rose.<br> &#x201c;That Ada Concannon is a peculiarly restless girl,&#x201d; Cook says. &#x201c;Her father might do better finding her a husband.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll hand over a golden guinea to Concannon if he can find a husband for any of his girls. The men are all dead of the Hunger or gone on the boat. Good luck to him nabbing one man between the eight of them.&#x201d;<br> I hear the rustle of Mrs. Rathcliffe&#x2019;s skirts, and I run along the passageway. Rose smiles when I enter the scullery, her cheeks already glistening from the steam. The room is small, and though Rose is, too, she seems to fill it. I put my finger to my lips.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m to work here with you,&#x201d; I whisper. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not allowed talk.&#x201d; Rose grins. &#x201c;That will hardly suit you, Ada.&#x201d; She takes a dolly&nbsp;tub from its rack and readies it for soaking clothes. &#x201c;What will I do, Rose?&#x201d;<br> She points to a hare that is stretched out in the cold-water sink. &#x201c;That needs skinning.&#x201d;<br> I grab the hare by the ears and lay it out on a board. Using a small knife, I slit the animal behind the ear and stick my finger inside; I pull the fur off its back and go at the legs.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather be laying out the morning tea in the servants&#x2019; hall or blacking the grate in Lady Elizabeth&#x2019;s parlor than doing this.&#x201d; &#x201c;Of course you would, Ada. But Daddy did warn you. You&nbsp;wouldn&#x2019;t be told.&#x201d;<br> I throw the hare onto its belly and fillet the back, my knife skimming its backbone as I cut. &#x201c;God Almighty, will I be stuck here forever?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m stuck here. It does me no harm.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;re &nbsp;content &nbsp;in yourself, Rose. You know what I&#x2019;m&nbsp;like&#x2014;restless as a pup.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s Daddy going to say to you, Ada? And Mammy?&#x201d; She puts a bundle of chemises into the tub. &#x201c;Will you be paid the same as me now?&#x201d;<br> I shrug, but I wonder if that is what will happen; the thought of it shames me. I would be better off finding a new position else- where if they mean to make an example of me altogether. I curse Mrs. Rathcliffe. I curse myself for my morning dip in the river.<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s next for me, Rose. I don&#x2019;t know at all.&#x201d;<br> I cut in under the hare&#x2019;s ribs, then drag the rest of the meat off with my hands, enjoying the sinewy rip of it. Each pull of the flesh tugs a fierce grunt from my throat. &nbsp;I glance up to see my sister watching me, and though I smile at her, her look in return is doubtful. <i>I&#x2019; ll show them, </i>I think&#x2014;Cook &nbsp;and Mrs. Rathcliffe and Daddy and them all. They&#x2019;ll see that I was made for more than the scullery. I&#x2019;ll do something &nbsp;that&nbsp; will shake the lot of them, &nbsp;and though I have no idea yet what it might be, it will be big.<br> <i>Miss Emily Surveys Amherst</i><br> &nbsp;<br> The July air in Amherst always hums with heat and promise. The conservatory is too greenly stuffy today, so I climb up and up through &nbsp;the house to the cupola. It is warm too and smells of the camphor gum I scatter to deter moths; I like this place to be truly my own&#x2014;not even insects are welcome. It is my lamp atop the house, my spy hole.<br> I peer down onto Main Street, hoping to see Susan walking out from the Evergreens with little Ned, thinking she might pass on her way to the Sweetsers&#x2019; house. Alas, she is not abroad. Looking down into the garden, I see that the top of Austin&#x2019;s <i>Quercus alba </i>is rich with foliage; how proud he is of that &nbsp;oak. Across the meadow the factory churns out the palm hats that adorn heads from Maine to Oregon. And far off, the Pelham Hills are a lilac shimmer under the haze. I wonder what it would be like to be up on the hills now, looking back at Amherst, all snug and industrious in the summer heat.<br> I think &nbsp;of yesterday and the sweet afternoon &nbsp;I spent with&nbsp;Susan in the garden of the Evergreens.<br> &#x201c;Do you realize, Sue,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;that we know each other twenty years this summer?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Truly, Emily? Can it be that we first met in &#x2018;46? Why, yes, it&nbsp;must be so.&#x201d; She smiled one of her glorious smiles, and the lamb&nbsp;hairpin that Austin gifted her on their marriage seemed to smile along with her. &#x201c;How wonderful to have remained such steadfast friends through all of life&#x2019;s ripples.&#x201d; She took my hand in hers and pumped it; we both laughed.<br> Dear, radiant Sue. Whatever would I do without her? She has a patient, committed ear. She is the only audience my heart trusts, and to her alone I gift my deepest thoughts, my most profound self. For sure we have had our bumps; she is somewhat unknowable and changeable, and I am perhaps a little too needy for her at times. And when she and Austin kept their engagement secret&#x2014;and for so many months&#x2014;I &nbsp;was undone. But we jog along, and all those years ago I soon realized that her being wedded to Austin was an opportunity. What better way to retain a loved friend than through matrimony with one&#x2019;s own brother? Ten years on from their marriage, it is one of my greatest blessings to have her next door.<br> Sue lifted her face to me. &#x201c;I really liked the poem you sent me yesterday, Emily. There is such joy in it. I could not say I under- stood it all, but the image of the bee was rather beautiful. You find poetry everywhere, my dear.&#x201d;<br> I can send Sue a note or poem on any old scrap&#x2014;she does not expect gilt-edged formality. She is as hungry to read my words as I am to write them. &nbsp;It &nbsp;is our small conspiracy: I show all my writings to Sue, and she makes helpful remarks that I mull over and accept or reject. Her wish is to help me to accomplish the best possible poem, not mold my words to her desire, which is what I fear from others.<br> Several women pass on the street below the house, parasols shielding their faces from the sun. I think to let out a cry or make a birdcall, but they might look up to the cupola and see me, catch me in my silliness. It would achieve nothing &nbsp;but to give them&nbsp;fodder with which to discuss me. Austin says I am much gossiped&nbsp;about already, and clearly it displeases him. But what is there for me to do about it? I have my own ways. I opt not to whistle or startle the parasol women, and they walk on unawares, leaving me free of their glances, their disapproval. But I still ponder that of my brother. He has become stern over the years; he was such a blithe boy. The demands of marriage and upright citizenship have stiffened him somewhat, but surely not completely? He won the prize&#x2014;Susan! Perhaps he tries too hard to be manly, to be more like Father, and, in trying, he chooses Father&#x2019;s worst traits to em- ulate. I know not. I only see that the soft brother of our youth hides himself well now.<br> It is stifling in the cupola, though the full views of Amherst please me; I am an eagless in her eyrie. I look across at the tower atop Austin and Sue&#x2019;s house and wonder if we will talk again soon, if she will come to me, to sit awhile and tell me of new books she has read or people she has recently met. When &nbsp;we sat together yesterday, we hardly spoke of now; we let ourselves linger in our younger days, recalling hours spent at her sister&#x2019;s house when they first moved to Amherst.<br> I am eager to let Sue know that we will shortly have a new maid and therefore I shall be able to spend more time composing notes and poems to her and maybe, if I am up to it, sitting in her company. Sue&#x2019;s face is rounded out these days because of the baby that makes a small mountain of her front. The extra flesh on her cheeks suits her, as everything does. Sweet Sue, my own Dollie, my nearly-sister. She is as good as any true sister and more besides.<br> I take one last look from each of the four windows and de- scend to my room. My desk sits forlorn by the window; a swath of peach light crosses its cherrywood like an invitation. &nbsp;I look at Elizabeth Barrett Browning and George Eliot in their frames on&nbsp;the wall and know that &nbsp;they understand &nbsp;my distress at my enforced absence from words.<br> At night, when I am not too bone weary, I dream. I would love to live in the softer planet of dreams. But if I cannot live in dreamworlds&#x2014;those palpable fantasies that are conjured from fancy, as much as from the stuff of life&#x2014;then I am content &nbsp;to invent parallel worlds. Places of the imagination that I alone can inhabit. And these destinations are made of words.<br> &#x201c;Emily! Emily, come now.&#x201d;<br> It is Vinnie calling, and I go down to her in the kitchen. She is sweating over a mound of crockery, and it is my duty to help, it seems. One &nbsp;of her menagerie strolls along the table toward the butter dish, tail cocked like a lord.<br> &#x201c;See how Mr. Puss preens,&#x201d; I say to Vinnie, who smiles the indulgent, motherly smile reserved for her charges.<br> I grab a cloth and begin to dry and stack the dishes. I lean into&nbsp;Vinnie&#x2019;s side and chant into her ear:<br>&nbsp;<br> <i>&#x201c; &#x2014;His porcelain&#x2014; Like a Cup&#x2014;</i><br> <i>Discarded of the Housewife&#x2014; Quaint&#x2014;or Broke&#x2014;</i><br> <i>A newer S�vres pleases&#x2014; Old Ones crack.&#x201d;</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Less poetry, more drudgery, please, Emily.&#x201d; She flicks water droplets at my face, and I muss her curls, then pick up another plate to dry it.<br> &#x201c;The opposite is my life&#x2019;s hopeful refrain these days, Vinnie.<br> &#x2018;More poetry, less drudgery.&#x2019; Perhaps I could compose a verse on that.&#x201d;<br><br> <i>Miss Ada L...</i></p><h2>Hurry Up and Meditate: Your Starter Kit for Inner Peace and Better Health</h2><p>If meditation were available in capsule form, it would be the biggest selling drug of all time. It has been scientifically proven to deliver highly effective stress relief, boost our immune systems, and dramatically slow the aging process. It has also been shown to make us much happier and more effective thinkers. Given all the physical and psychological benefits, why aren't more of us doing it? In this thought-provoking and entertaining book, David Michie explains the nuts and bolts of meditation. As a busy professional and a long-term meditator, he also gives a first-hand account of how to integrate this transformational practice into everyday life. Combining leading-edge science with timeless wisdom, <i>Hurry Up and Meditate</i> provides all the motivation and tools you need to achieve greater balance, better health, and develop a more panoramic perspective on life. The idea of infusing our daily schedule with newfound tranquility may sound appealing, but not everyone is temperamentally suited to sitting around in the lotus position chanting "Om." Not to mention the fact that some of us just have very active minds. We'd like to meditate, but we're just not capable of switching off.&nbsp; The the amazing thing is that it's exactly the people who use the "too busy," "'too hard," and "too hyper" justifications who stand to gain the most from meditation.</p><p>&#34;A time to rest and think has numerous health benefits...but really, who has the time? Hurry Up and Meditate is a guide to making time for a little peace, quiet, and meditation when one&#39;s life doesn&#39;t seem to present any opportunity for it. With a blend of scientific logic and poignant wisdom, Michie offers a plan that can improve one&#39;s quality of life in ways they didn&#39;t think possible.&#34;--Library BookwatchDavid Michie is a corporate communications consultant, published novelist, and Buddhist practitioner.

Every day he gets up before dawn, makes a cup of coffee in the dark, lights a fire with one wooden match, and thinks.<br><br>What Emmett thinks about is the subject of this wise and closely observed novel, which covers vast distances while moving no further than Emmett&#x2019;s hearth and home. Nicholson Baker&#x2019;s extraordinary ability to describe and celebrate life in all its rich ordinariness has never been so beautifully achieved.</p><p>One man's simple, colloquial meditations on his past, his family, and his life's daily minutia are the substance of Nicholson Baker's <i>A Box of Matches</i>. Feeling that life is passing him by, Emmett, a middle-aged medical textbook editor, decides to wake up early each day to sit by a fire in his country house and record his thoughts in a diary. "Good morning," Emmett begins, "it's January and its 4:17 a.m., and I'm going to sit here in the dark." From this vantage point, Emmett reflects stream-of-consciousness style on whatever occurs to him, no matter how mundane: his recent trip to Home Depot, how he met his wife, the habits of the family duck. Routines, such as how he makes his morning coffee in the dark or picks up his underwear with his toes, are described with childlike reverence and directness. All told, nothing much happens in <i>A Box of Matches</i>, which seems to be the point. Baker is more interested in the idea that for many, life is made up of such apparent trivialities, and that only by pausing to appreciate them can anyone gain any lasting satisfaction. Baker emphasizes this through the moments of understated wisdom and joy that Emmett derives from ordinary occurrences, such as the daylight through the window: "a simple light that goes everywhere but with no heat, aware that it is taken for granted and content to be so." This is the philosophical equivalent of a one-joke premise, however, and there are moments when Emmett's naivet� and laundry list-like narrative wear thin. Likely understanding this, Baker has wisely kept things short. A curious, often charming novel, <i>A Box of Matches</i> will inspire some readers, while inspiring frustration in others. <i>--Ross Doll</i>PRAISE FOR <i>DOUBLE FOLD</i><br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no mistaking the passion and intelligence he brings to his task or the fiery zest with which he relays his most damning anecdotes.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Chicago Tribune</i><br><br>&#x201c;Provocative . . . impassioned and compelling.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i><br><br>PRAISE FOR <i>THE EVERLASTING STORY OF NORY</i><br><br>&#x201c;Delightful . . .

His books have also earned praisefrom the National Council of Social Studies, theInternational Reading Association, and the Children's BookCouncil. Paul lives in Rapid City, South Dakota.Grade 1-4&#x2013;An author's note introduces this story as an adaptation of the song from <i>TheLiturgy of the Hours and The Book of Common Prayer</i>. The basis of this text is the song of praise that saved Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego from death in the furnace from the Book of Daniel. Goble includes the familiar verse, in which heavens, angels, sun, moon, and the entire Earth sing songs of praise, and includes animals and plants of America as additional elements that also send out prayers to God. Dandelions, meadowlarks, cranes, vultures, and moths are raised to the level of stars of heaven and winds of God in singing praise. The refrain, "praise him, and magnify him forever," appears after each element sings its praise. Fans of Goble's distinctive style will enjoy examining the detailed illustrations. A white buffalo calf rubs noses with others in his herd, woodpeckers nestle in birches, and great sturgeons swim among sunfishes and trout. Goble also honors the natural world, and the book never becomes didactic or preachy.

Imprisoned for some weeks in a wire cage open to the elements, Pound suffered a nervous collapse from the physical and emotional strain. Out of the agony of his own inferno came the eleven cantos that became the sixth book of his modernist epic, <em>The Cantos</em>, themselves conceived as a <em>Divine Comedy</em> for our time. <em>The Pisan Cantos</em> were published in 1948 by New Directions and in the following year were awarded the Bollingen Prize for poetry by the Library of Congress. The honor came amid violent controversy, for the dark cloud of treason still hung over Pound, incarcerated in St. Elizabeths Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Yet there is no doubt that <em>The Pisan Cantos</em> displays some of his finest and most affecting writing, marking an elegaic turn to the personal while synthesizing the philosophical and economic political themes of his previous cantos. They are now being published for the first time as a separate paperback, in a fully annotated edition prepared by Richard Sieburth, who also contributes a thoroughgoing introduction, making Pound's master-work fully accessible to students and general readers.</p><p><p>New Directions has been the primary publisher of <strong>Ezra Pound</strong> in the U.S. since the founding of the press when James Laughlin published New Directions in Prose and Poetry 1936. That year Pound was fifty-one. In Laughlin&#x2019;s first letter to Pound, he wrote: &#x201c;Expect, please, no fireworks. I am bourgeois-born (Pittsburgh); have never missed a meal. . . . But full of &#x2018;noble caring&#x2019; for something as inconceivable as the future of decent letters in the US.&#x201d; Little did Pound know that into the twenty-first century the fireworks would keep exploding as readers continue to find his books relevant and meaningful.</p><p>Award-winning translator, scholar, and essayist <strong>Richard Sieburth</strong> has translated books by Henri Michaux, Friedrich H�lderlin, Louise Lab�, G�rard de Nerval, and Nostradamus.&nbsp;</p>&#x201c;It is in <em>The Pisan Cantos</em> that we can approach Pound most closely as a person.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>James Laughlin, <em>Pound As Wuz</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Sieburth has done a strikingly good job....His introduction...is a model of its kind...a serious work of criticism.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Clive Wilmer, <em>Times Literary Supplement</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The introduction is one of the best short essays [on Pound] I have read.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Marjorie Perloff, <em>Boston Review</em></strong></p><h2>Captain John Smith: A Foothold in the New World (Heroes of History)</h2><p>The mainsail cracked above them in the ferocious wind as a group of red-faced men descended on John.

Olga Kotelko is not your average ninety-four-year-old. She not only looks and acts like a much younger woman, she holds over twenty-three world records in track and field, seventeen in her current ninety to ninety-five category. Convinced that this remarkable woman could help unlock many of the mysteries of aging, Grierson set out to uncover what it is that's driving Olga. He considers every piece of the puzzle, from her diet and sleep habits to how she scores on various personality traits, from what she does in her spare time to her family history. Olga participates in tests administered by some of the world's leading scientists and offers her DNA to groundbreaking research trials. What emerges is not only a tremendously uplifting personal story but a look at the extent to which our health and longevity are determined by the DNA we inherit at birth, and the extent to which we can shape that inheritance. It examines the sum of our genes, opportunities, and choices, and the factors that forge the course of any life, especially during our golden years.</p></p><p><b>Bruce Grierson</b> is the author of the books <i>Culture Jam</i> and <i>U-Turn</i>. He has been a freelance writer for twenty-five years. His work has appeared in <i>The New York Times Magazine</i> and <i>Psychology Today</i>, among other publications. He lives in North Vancouver, Canada.<p>Prologue</p> <p>Ever since she turned 90, Olga Kotelko has presented a problem for organizers of the track meets she enters: Whom does she compete against?</p> <p>The issue surfaced prominently in the 60-meter-dash final at the World Masters Indoor Athletics Championships, in Kamloops, British Columbia, in 2010. Olga found herself, well, in a class by herself. There just aren&#x2019;t many nonagenarian sprinters&#x2014;even when you draw from the whole planet. The next-oldest woman in this meet, Californian Johnnye Vallien, was 84.</p> <p>So there Olga was, 91, bespandexed and elfin, lumped in with the men.</p> <p>In lane one stood Orville Rogers, 91, a long-striding retired Braniff Airways pilot and the world-record holder in the mile for men over 90. Next to him: Belgian Emiel Pauwels, 90, another world-record middle-distance man (1,500-meter), in bright orange track spikes, who would later make everyone nervous as he ran most of the 3,000-meter final with his left shoelace untied. Front and center: Ugo Sansonetti, 92, a former frozen-food magnate from Rome, in a blue sleeveless skinsuit, his tanned biceps bulging like small baked potatoes.</p> <p>Olga drew the inside lane, rounding out the field. She wore black tights and a long-sleeved white shirt&#x2014;the modest uniform she wears no matter the weather.</p> <p>She&#x2019;d been worried about her start. She&#x2019;s not a good starter. She can get rattled. Sometimes, when the gun sounds or even a fraction of a second before, she takes a step <i>backward</i>. But today she started clean and mechanically strong, piston-pumping her arms, generating enough wind to pin her hair back a bit.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s no longer strange to see geriatric runners: every big-city marathon has its share of valiant, white-haired competitors who spark bursts of applause as they shuffle past. But it <i>is</i> strange to watch 90-year-olds sprint. Kids and dogs and young adults run full-out. But old folks? The incongruity of that image inspired a television commercial that Ugo Sansonetti shot for Bertolli margarine not long ago. A runaway baby carriage is seen careening through the streets of Rome, until a fissure-faced old bystander&#x2014;Ugo&#x2014;springs into action and chases it down.</p> <p>Sansonetti crossed the line first at Kamloops, in a world-record time of 11.57 seconds. He bounced around in the run-off area, arms overhead in triumph, as Rogers glided in behind him at 12.82. Olga came third, at just over 15 seconds. She looked concerned for Pauwels, the Belgian, who had caught a spike and crashed down hard, then picked himself up and limped in last.</p> <p>She was cool with running against the guys. &#x201c;That one fellow was pretty fast,&#x201d; she said, on the way to the changing area. She had gotten used to this. When you&#x2019;re the fastest 91-year-old woman on the planet, either you compete against younger women or you run against the guys.</p> <p><br>Just how good is Olga? There are a couple of ways to put her in perspective.</p> <p>She currently holds twenty-six world records. She set twenty world records in a single year, 2009. She hits these totals in part by entering more events than everybody else, including a couple that nobody else in the world her age attempts. She will often do six throwing events, three sprints, and three jumps. (At age 88, she considered adding the pole vault, but was deterred by practical considerations. &#x201c;What do you do with the pole&#x2014;strap it to the roof of the car? Check it on to the plane?&#x201d;)</p> <p>Track records, at the elite level, tend to fall by fingernail parings of time and distance: fractions of seconds, portions of inches. At the 2009 World Masters Athletics Championships in Lahti, Finland, Olga threw a javelin almost <i>twenty feet</i> farther than her nearest rival. At the World Masters Games in Sydney, Australia, in 2009, Olga&#x2019;s time in the 100-meter dash&#x2014;23.95 seconds&#x2014;would have won the women&#x2019;s 80&#x2013;84 division&#x2014;two age brackets down.</p> <p>Olga stands five feet and a half an inch. She weighs 130 pounds. For her size&#x2014;and this may be the most curious thing about her&#x2014;she has extraordinary power. It can be surprising, after her slo-mo windup, to see how far the things she throws go.</p> <p>On the hammer throw pitch in Kamloops, she took her place with the other competitors. Big guys with leather gloves paced around, shaking their hands out. Olga removed her glasses. There was a sudden and brief sense of menace; when a little old lady starts swinging a three-pound cannonball around her head, a good outcome is not guaranteed. But the thing sailed, straight and true. &#x201c;If I spun I could throw it farther,&#x201d; Olga says, but after watching somebody very old fall that way she has decided not to risk it.</p> <p>Olga got more leg into the second throw. But the trajectory wasn&#x2019;t what she liked. She made a little swan&#x2019;s head gesture with her hand, to remind herself. Routinely, Olga performs better on every subsequent attempt as she recalibrates and tries again. It&#x2019;s like watching a marksman bracket the bull&#x2019;s-eye and then draw in: 12.72 meters. 13.37. 13.92. In ten minutes she added four feet of distance. &#x201c;New world record,&#x201d; a disembodied voice said over the loudspeaker.</p> <p>There is a formula called &#x201c;age-grading&#x201d; that&#x2019;s used to put the performances of older athletes in perspective. Age-graded scores tell us how impressed we should be by what a masters athlete&#x2014;placed in categories from ages 35 to 105&#x2014;just did. A set of tables plots a given performance against the expected decline of the human body, and expresses it as a percentage. So, theoretically, 100 percent is the high-water mark for a human being of that age.</p> <p>But a number of Olga&#x2019;s marks&#x2014;in shot put, high jump, 100-meter dash&#x2014;top 100 percent. In Sydney she threw the shot put 5.6 meters&#x2014;which age-grades out at 119 percent. If you plug Olga&#x2019;s 23.95 100-meter-dash time from Sydney into the tables, you find it&#x2019;s exactly equivalent to American Olympian Florence Griffith Joyner&#x2019;s prevailing, suspicious, and thought-to-be-untouchable world record of 10.49 seconds.</p> <p>Remarkably, when you age-grade, you find Olga is not only holding her own but in some cases getting better&#x2014;which suggests that either the tables are wonky or Olga is. Most likely both are true. &#x201c;She throws off the curve, because she&#x2019;s doing things nobody&#x2019;s ever done,&#x201d; says Ken Stone, editor of masters-track.com, the watering hole of the masters track community. (Motto: &#x201c;Older, Slower, Lower.&#x201d;) But at the same time, some recent performances speak for themselves. &#x201c;I threw the hammer farther this year than I did two years ago,&#x201d; she mentioned recently, offhandedly. &#x201c;How do you explain that?&#x201d; No two ways about it: Olga is defying, or rewriting, our understanding of the retention of human physical capability.</p> <p>When people hear how old she is, they seem to look at her more deeply, at her face. To be blunt: she is not aging normally.</p> <p>&#x201c;How old do you <i>feel</i>?&#x201d; I asked her on her 91st birthday.</p> <p>She thought about that. &#x201c;Fifty?&#x201d; She gave a half shrug. &#x201c;I still have the energy I had at fifty,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;More. Where is it coming from? Honestly, I don&#x2019;t know. I wish I knew. It&#x2019;s a mystery even to me.&#x201d;</p> <p><br>They say she is like Grandma Moses, in the sense that she found her calling very late in life. But while Grandma Moses took up painting out of desperation, to make ends meet, Olga took up track, at age 77, for fun. A dozen years retired from her career as an elementary school teacher, she still had lightning in her that needed grounding.</p> <p>For the first half of her track career&#x2014;till around age 85&#x2014;she coasted under the radar, quietly breaking world records within a subculture obscure enough (track and field for old people!) that many people still don&#x2019;t know it exists. But since she turned 90, media interest in Olga has made it hard for her to hide. Reporters from around the world have made pilgrimages to her home on the flank of Hollyburn Mountain, overlooking the Pacific Ocean in West Vancouver. There is usually pleasant chitchat, and the reporter, having heard the jokes that the fountain of youth burbles up in her backyard, just behind the organic vegetable garden, makes an excuse to snoop around.</p> <p>Because, seriously: when you&#x2019;re breaking records, rather than hips, at an age most people will never live to see . . . what gives?</p> <p>Aging is supposed to be one of those nonnegotiables: just the cost of doing life. It is, as the Stanford professor of medicine Walter Bortz put it, &#x201c;a stern expression of the Second Law of Thermodynamics from which there is no respite.&#x201d; So how do you begin to think about someone like Olga, short of demanding to see her birth certificate or otherwise trying to debunk her story? What seems to be required is a leap in the way we understand the aging process, as scientific advancements slowly reveal clues.</p> <p>Indeed, for a stage of life that 90 million baby boomers in North America alone are barreling toward, surprisingly little is known about old age. (Or maybe it&#x2019;s not so surprising: old age was a nonissue in human history until very recently. More than half the people <i>who have ever</i> reached age 65 are alive today, some demographers believe.)</p> <p>But lack of data has never stood in the way of forceful opinion. Just about everyone has a guess about what makes Olga run. It&#x2019;s genes. It&#x2019;s diet. It&#x2019;s temperament. It&#x2019;s her unusual paleo sleep patterns. It&#x2019;s the fighting spirit of the Cossack general from whom she is descended. It&#x2019;s energy: she is vibrating at a higher frequency than most anyone else. It&#x2019;s the miracle of exercise itself, compounded over a long, long lifetime. It&#x2019;s performance-enhancing drugs. (Actually, we can rule that one out: she&#x2019;s clean.)</p> <p>In the morning&#x2014;very early or merely early, depending on the day&#x2014;Olga gets up and puts the kettle on for Krakus, a Polish coffee substitute made from roasted flax, barley, and beetroot. Then she heads into the bathroom to wash her face. The woman looking back at her in the mirror contains multitudes. She is the sweet-natured grandma with a competitive streak so ferocious she aims to set marks that eclipse the past greats and make up-and-comers think about maybe trying out scrapbooking instead. The farm girl who outlived ten siblings and one of her two daughters, and ponders what is being asked of her, the survivor. The levelheaded pragmatist with abiding faith in water, reflexology, and a curious routine of massaging and stretching her muscles in the dead of night.</p> <p>Olga and I met four years ago. I was one of those nosy writers who showed up at her home: the in-law apartment in the basement of her daughter and son-in-law&#x2019;s house.</p> <p>It was a tidy space. Her own paintings of landscapes, marinas, and flowers from the garden hung on the walls. She offered tea. She had kind eyes and carefully applied lipstick and a shy demeanor. It was hard to reconcile this gentle person with the figure conjured by the growing mythology&#x2014;a woman whose warrior fire is so intense that when she first announced she was interested in track, and a well-meaning friend said, &#x201c;The event you want is the racewalk,&#x201d; the advice literally did not make sense to her. Seriously? Walking or racing: which were they talking about here?</p> <p>I&#x2019;d hoped we could go to the running oval at the local high school so I could observe Olga in action. But it was pounding rain outside, so instead we stayed in and talked. We went through her notebooks documenting thirteen years of increasingly unlikely levels of achievement in track and field. At the end she cracked open the door to a closet. It looked like what Geraldo had hoped to find in Al Capone&#x2019;s vault. Gold shone forth. Hundreds of medals hung from groaning hooks.</p> <p>If a writer can become infected by a story, that&#x2019;s what happened to me that day. Olga started to feel more interesting, more <i>important</i> than everything else I was thinking about. She&nbsp;tolerated my endless questions, probably because they were the same kinds of questions she had about herself. Eventually we&nbsp;struck a deal: we would become a team. We would explore the mystery of her together. She would offer herself up to science while I took notes. We would tap the expertise of some of the top practitioners of exercise physiology and gerontology, neuropsychology and evolutionary medicine.</p> <p>To be honest, I had a secondary, selfish motive. I felt a personal stake in what the data about Olga would reveal, because I had my own mystery to solve.</p> <p>You see, I used to be fit, too&#x2014;not Olga-fit, but fit. I started exercising, in a pretty committed and deliberate way, when I was a skinny kid of nine. I got good tennis coaching and started beating adults, via a style of steady, craven retrieval that wore them out (and ticked them off). A running addiction that took hold around age twenty ensured that I kept grinding out workouts into my thirties and forties. Pairs of Nikes&#x2014;each dutifully retired after six hundred miles&#x2014;piled up in the closet like cordwood until:</p> <p>Boom. Something . . . gave. Age flooded in all at once. It really did feel that sudden. Gone, just like that, the jump, the stamina, the drive, the memory, the hair. Gone, any right to use the noun &#x201c;performance,&#x201d; in any context. And with those changes came a fairly radical shift in attitude. Each sunrise no longer dialed up a sense of hope but resignation.</p> <p>How does this happen? I was 47. Could it be the inevitable midlife swoon we&#x2019;re warned about, the one that starts with stretch jeans and topical ibuprofen and ends up with saltless dinners in the extended-care wing? Well, clearly it&#x2019;s not inevitable, because there before me was Olga. Whatever was happening with her was the opposite of what was happening to me. If she was the paragon of healthy aging, I was a proxy for every once-hale boomer now alarmingly on the skids.</p> <p>Some serious sleuthing was in order. It would require going back in time to peek in on Olga as her current self was still under construction. What was she doing, at my age and younger, that was so forward-thinking, so right (or maybe just so lucky)? And could those habits be wrenches to fix the mistakes the rest of us are making, before it&#x2019;s too late?</p> <p><br>Copyright � 2014 by Bruce Grierson</p></p><h2>The Season: A Social History of the Debutante</h2><p><p><strong>In this enthralling history of the debutante ritual, Kristen Richardson sheds new light on contemporary ideas about women and marriage.</strong></p><p>Kristen Richardson, from a family of debutantes, chose not to debut. But as her curiosity drove her to research this enduring custom, she learned that it, and debutantes, are not as simple as they seem.</p><p>The story begins in England six hundred years ago when wealthy fathers needed an efficient way to find appropriate husbands for their daughters. Elizabeth I&#x2019;s exclusive presentations at her court expanded into London&#x2019;s full season of dances, dinners, and courting, extending eventually to the many corners of the British empire and beyond.</p><p>Richardson traces the social seasons of young women on both sides of the Atlantic, from Georgian England to colonial Philadelphia, from the Antebellum South and Wharton&#x2019;s New York back to England, where debutante daughters of Gilded Age millionaires sought to marry British aristocrats. She delves into Jazz Age debuts, carnival balls in the American South, and the reimagined ritual of elite African American communities, which offers both social polish and academic scholarships.</p><p><em>The Season</em> shares the captivating stories of these young women, often through their words from diaries, letters, and interviews that Richardson conducted at contemporary balls. The debutantes give voice to an array of complex feelings about being put on display, about the young men they meet, and about what their future in society or as wives might be.</p><p>While exploring why the debutante tradition persists&#x2015;and why it has spread to Russia, China, and other nations&#x2015;Richardson has uncovered its extensive cultural influence on the lives of daughters in Britain and the US and how they have come to marry.</p> 8 pages of illustrations</p><p>Kristen Richardson was born in London, and lives with her son in Brooklyn.&#x201c;My grandmother was presented to England&#x2019;s King George V and my mother was Queen of the Veiled Prophet in St. Louis, but it wasn&#x2019;t until I read <em>The Season</em> that I understood the enduring fascination and importance of that ritual. Kristen Richardson shows us, with wit and insight, how unmarried girls in long white dresses have publicly embodied the prestige of successful families&#x2015;across centuries and around the world.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Carol Wallace, coauthor of <em>To Marry an English Lord</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Class power has never been about wealth alone. As Kristen Richardson skillfully and colorfully documents, the marriage market&#x2013;&#x2013;and the courtly ritual of the debutante&#x2013;&#x2013;lays open a long, troubling, transatlantic history. This engaging book reminds us that &#x2018;mock royalty&#x2019; and the trophy daughter, whether it&#x2019;s Consuelo Vanderbilt in 1894 or Ivanka Trump more recently, are at the center of America&#x2019;s love affair with the rich and beautiful.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Nancy Isenberg, author of <em>White Trash: The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Who knew being a debutante was so tough, and so fascinating?

Lucey, author of <em>Sargent&#x2019;s Women: Four Lives Behind the Canvas</em></strong></p><h2>Weird Realism: Lovecraft and Philosophy</h2><p>As H�lderlin was to Martin Heidegger and Mallarm� to Jacques Derrida, so is H.P. Lovecraft to the Speculative Realist philosophers. Lovecraft was one of the brightest stars of the horror and science fiction magazines, but died in poverty and relative obscurity in the 1930s. In 2005 he was finally elevated from pulp status to the classical literary canon with the release of a Library of America volume dedicated to his work. The impact of Lovecraft on philosophy has been building for more than a decade. Initially championed by shadowy guru Nick Land at Warwick during the 1990s, he was later discovered to be an object of private fascination for all four original members of the twenty-first century Speculative Realist movement. In this book, Graham Harman extracts the basic philosophical concepts underlying the work of Lovecraft, yielding a weird realism capable of freeing continental philosophy from its current soul-crushing impasse. Abandoning pious references by Heidegger to H�lderlin and the Greeks, Harman develops a new philosophical mythology centered in such Lovecraftian figures as Cthulhu, Wilbur Whately, and the rat-like monstrosity Brown Jenkin. The Miskatonic River replaces the Rhine and the Ister, while H�lderlin&#39;s Caucasus gives way to Lovecraft&#39;s Antarctic mountains of madness.</p><p><table><tbody><tr><td>Graham Harman is Associate Provost for Research Administration and Professor of Philosophy at the American University in Cairo, Egypt. He was born in Iowa City, Iowa in 1968, the first of three sons of hippie parents who met at a Rolling Stones concert in Chicago. He received his undergraduate degree from the classical liberal arts program at St. John's College, Annapolis (1990). His Master's Degree was done at Penn State (1991) under the renowned philosopher Alphonso Lingis, and focused on Levinas. He completed his Ph.D. at DePaul University in Chicago (1999), with a dissertation that became his first book. While finishing his doctoral studies, he worked as a Chicago sportswriter from 1996-98. In September 2000 he began work in the Department of Philosophy at the American University in Cairo.

Lopez writes in spare prose, but his narratives resonate with an uncanny power. With a reverence for our exterior and interior landscapes, these stories offer profound insight into the relationships between humans and animals, creativity and beauty, and, ultimately, life and death. Again and again, whether describing a Navajo rug possessing the essence of its maker, a boy who can change places with his half-coyote dog (named Leaves), or a teacher whose presence brings into question the meaning of friendship, Lopez portrays elemental and sacred places. His prose transcends its simplicity to enter spaces of wonder and mystery. As James Perrin Warren says in his compelling introduction, Lopez&#x2019;s narrators bear witness to extraordinary patterns and purposes . . . The storyteller is vital to the community and to a healthy landscape, but the vital relationship is also reciprocal. . . . We participate, along with Lopez, in the long history of storytelling. We become part of the atmosphere in which wisdom shows itself.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Barry Lopez</b> is an essayist, author, and short story writer who traveled extensively in both remote and populated parts of the world.

I do not think you know it is raining. You are oblivious to the thuck of drops rolling off the rube of your neck and the slope of your back. (Above, in the sweepy cedars, drops pool at the tips of leather needles, break away, are sheered by the breeze and, thuck, hit the hollow-boned, crimson-colored shoulders of the bird and fall swooning into the river.)<br><br>Perhaps you know it is raining. The intensity of your stare is then not oblivion, only an effort to spot between the rain splashes in the river (past your feet, so well-known, there beneath the hammered surface, like twigs in the pebbles) the movement of a trout.<br><br>I know: your way is to be inscrutable. When pressed you leave. This is no more unexpected or mysterious than that you give birth to shadows. Or silence. I watch from a distance. With respect. I think of standing beside you when you have died of your own brooding over the water--as shaken as I would be at the collapse of a cathedral, wincing deep inside as at the screech of an overloaded cart. <br><br>You carry attribution well, refusing to speak. With your warrior&#x2019;s feathers downsloped at the back of your head, those white sheaves formed like a shield overlaying your breast, your gray-blue cast, the dark tail feathers--do you wear wolves&#x2019; tails about your ankles and dance in clearings in the woods when your blood is running? I wonder where you have fought warrior: Where!<br><br>You retreat beneath your cowl, spread wings, rise, drift upriver as silent as winter trees.<br>I follow you. You have caught me with your reticence. I will listen to whatever they say about you, what anyone who has seen you wishes to offer--and I will return to call across the river to you, to confirm or deny. If you will not speak I will have to consider making you up.<br>Your sigh, I am told, is like the sound of rain driven against tower bells. You smell like wild ginger. When you lift your foot from the river, water doesn&#x2019;t run off it to spoil the transparent surface of the shallows. The water hesitates to offend you. You stare down with that great yellow eye, I am told, like some prehistoric rattlesnake: that dangerous, that blinding in your strike, that hate-ridden. But (someone else has insisted) you really do smell like wild ginger, and snakes smell like cucumbers. A false lead.<br><br>Cottonwoods along the river, stained with your white excrement, are young enough to volunteer complaint about you. The have grown so fast and so high with such little effort that they can understand neither failure nor triumph. So they will say anything they think might be to their advantage. I, after a somewhat more difficult life, am aware that they will lie, and that lies serve in their way.<br><br>(It was one of these who told me you were without mercy and snakelike.) One of them said something about your fishy breath--vulgar talk, I know. But I heard it out. It is, after all, in their branches where you have dreamed at night, as immobile as a piece of lumber left in their limbs, and considered your interior life. This idea attracts me. I know: this is not something to inquire into with impunity, but I did not start out on this to please you. And in spite of my impatience I am respectful.<br> <br>One dream alone reveals your grief. The trees said you dreamed most often of the wind, with the wind rippling your feathers; and that children were born of this, that they are the movement of water in all the rivers. You wade, it is suggested, among your children, staring hard, pecking in that lightning way your life from the water that is your child; and sleeping in trees that do not hold you sacred.<br><br>I know why you appear so fierce and self-contained. I can imagine fear in the form of a frog in your beak screaming and you, undisturbed, cool. When you finally speak up, feigning ignorance with me won&#x2019;t do; enigmatic locutions, distracting stories of the origin of the universe--these will not do. I expect the wisdom of the desert out of you.<br><br>The cottonwoods also told me of a dance, that you dreamed of a dance: more than a hundred great blue herons riveted by the light of dawn, standing with wind-ruffled feathers on broad slabs of speckled gray granite, river-washed bedrock, in that sharp, etching backlight, their sleek bills glinting, begin to lift their feet from the thin sheet of water and to put them back down. The sound of the rhythmic splash, the delicate kersplash of hundreds of feet, came up in the sound of the river and so at first was lost; but the shards of water, caught, blinding in the cutting light (now the voices, rising, a keening) began to form a mist in which appeared rainbows against the white soft breasts; and where drops of water dolloped like beads of mercury on the blue-gray feathers, small rainbows of light here; and in the eyes (as the voices, louder, gathering on one, high, trembling note) rainbows the birds cradled in light shattered in rainbows everywhere, and with your great blue wings fanning that brilliant mist, open, utterly vulnerable and stunning, you urged them to begin to revolve in the light, stretching their wings, and you lay back your head and closed the steely eyes and from deep within your belly came the roar of a cataract, like the howling of wolves that long moment of your mournful voice. The birds quieted, their voices quieted. The water quieted, it quieted, until there was only your quivering voice, the sound of the birth of rivers, tapering finally to silence, to the sound of dawn, the birds standing there full of grace. One or two feathers floating on the water.<br><br>I understand it is insensitive to inquire further, but you see how your silence becomes even more haunting.<br><br>I believe we will dance together someday. Before then will I have to have been a trout, bear scars from your stabbing misses and so have some deeper knowledge? Then will we dance? I cannot believe it is so far between knowing what must be done and doing it.<br>The cottonwoods said there was more, but I put up my hand, tired, on edge at the sound of my own voice asking questions. I went into the trees, wishing to cry, I thought, for what had been lost, feeling how little I knew, how anxious I was, how young.<br><br>The big maples, where you have slept since then--I resolved to ask them about your dreams. No; they refused. I climbed up in their limbs, imploring. They were silent. I was angered and made a fool of myself beating on the trunks with my fists screaming, Tell me about the bird! It is only a bird!&#x201d;<br><br>Learning your dreams unnerved me. What unholy trespass I had made.<br><br>When I regained my composure I apologized, touching the maple trunks gently with my fingers. As I departed a wind moved the leaves of a low branch against my face and I was embarrassed, for I was waiting for some sign of understanding. I walked on, alert now to the wind showing here and there in the grass. The wind suddenly spoke of you as of a father. The thoughts were incomplete, hinting at something incomprehensible, ungraspable, but I learned this: you are able to stand against you. You arrange yourself so that you cast no shadow and you stop breathing for half an hour. The only sound is the faint movement of your blood. You are quiet enough to hear fish swimming toward you.<br><br>When asked, discretely, whether long ago you might have fought someone, some enemy whose name I might recognize, the wind was suddenly no longer there. From such strength as is in you I suspect an enemy. I have inquired of the stones at the bottom of the river; I have inquired of your other enemy, the pine marten; I have waded silently with your relatives, the bitterns, alert for any remarks. All to no avail.<br><br>I have been crippled by my age, by what I have known. As well as by my youth, by what I have yet to learn, in all these inquiries. It has taken me years, which might have been spent (by someone else) seeking something greater, in some other place. I have sought only you. Enough. I wish to know you, and you will not speak.<br>It is not easy to tell the rest, but I know you have heard it from others. Now I wish you to hear it from me. I took bits of bone from fish you had eaten and pierced my fingers, letting the blood trail away in the current. I slept on what feathers of yours I could find. From a tree felled in a storm I took your nest, climbed with it to a clearing above the river where there was a good view, as much sky as I could comprehend. Bear grass, pentstemon, blue gilia, wild strawberries, Indian paintbrush growing there. Each night for four nights I made a small fire with sticks from the old nest and looked out toward the edge of the shadows it threw. On the last night I had a great dream. You were standing on a desert plain. You were painted blue and you wore a necklace of white salmon vertebrae. Your eyes huge, red. Before you on the dry, gray earth a snake coiled, slowly weaving the air with his head. You spoke about the beginning of the world, that everything that was afraid would live poorly.<br><br>The snake said coldly, weaving, yes, there would be fear, that fear would make everything strong and lashed out, opening a wound in your shoulder. As fast, you pinned his head to the ground and said--the calmness in your voice--fear might come, and it could make people strong, but it would be worth nothing without compassion. And you released the snake.<br>I awoke sprawled in bear grass. It was darker than I could ever remember a night being. I felt the spot on the planet where I lay, turned away from the sun. My legs ached. I knew how old I was lying there on top of the mountain, a fist of cold air against my breast as some animal, a mouse perhaps, moved suddenly under my back.<br><br>An unpronounceable forgiveness swept over me. I knew how much had to be given away, how little could ever be asked. The sound of geese overhead in the darkness just then, and all that it meant, was enough.<br>I leap into the jade color of the winter river: I fight the current to reach the rocks, climb up on them and listen for the sound of your voice. I stand dripping, shivering in my white nakedness, in the thin dawn light. Waiting. Silent. You begin to appear at a downriver bend.</p><h2>Historical Atlas of Washington and Oregon</h2><p>This gorgeous atlas, illustrated throughout with more than 500 colorful images and maps, provides a visually rich and textually engaging history of the states of Oregon and Washington.

Dockside informers lead Monk to a floating palace of corruption on the Thames managed by Parfitt, where a band of half-starved boys is held captive for men willing to pay a high price for midnight pleasures. Though Monk and his fearless wife, Hester, would gladly reward Parfitt&#x2019;s killer, duty leads them in another direction&#x2014;to an unresolved crime, to a deadly confrontation with some of the empire&#x2019;s most respected men, and ultimately to a courtroom showdown with Monk&#x2019;s old friend, Oliver Rathbone, in a trial of nearly unbearable tension and suspense.<br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&#x201c;Masterful storytelling . . .

Monk was motionless beside her, his hand loose on the pillow, his hair falling over his face.<br><br>It was not the first time in the last two weeks that Hester had heard Scuff crying in the night. It was a delicate relationship she had with the boy she and Monk had befriended. He had lived on the streets by the river and had largely provided for himself, which had made him wise beyond his age, and fiercely independent. He considered he was looking after Monk, who in Scuff's opinion lacked the knowledge and the fierce survival instincts required for his job as head of the Thames River Police at Wapping, in the heart of the London docks.<br><br>Until last month Scuff had come and gone as he'd pleased, spending only the occasional night at Monk's house in Paradise Place. However, since his kidnapping, and the atrocity on the boat at Execution Dock, he had come to live with them, going out only for short periods during the day, and tossing and turning at night, plagued by nightmares. He would not talk about them, and his pride would not let him admit to Hester that he was frightened of the dark, of closed doors, and, above all, of sleep.<br><br>Of course she knew why. Once the tight control he kept over himself in his waking hours slipped from him, he was back on the boat again, curled up on his side beneath the trapdoor to the bilges, nailed in with the -half--rotted corpse of the missing boy, fighting the swirling water and the rats, the stench of it making him gag.<br><br>In his nightmares it did not seem to matter that he was now free, or that Jericho Phillips was dead; Scuff had seen the man's body himself, imprisoned in the iron cage in the river, his mouth gaping open as the rising tide trapped him, choking off his voice forever.<br><br>Hester heard the gasping sound again, and slipped out of bed. She pulled on a wrap, not so much for warmth in the late September night, but for modesty so as not to embarrass Scuff if he was awake. She crept across the room and along the passage. His bedroom door was open just wide enough for him to pass through. The gas lamp was on low, maintaining the fiction that she had forgotten and left it on, as she did every night. Neither of them ever mentioned this.<br><br>Scuff was lying tangled in the sheets, the blankets slipped halfway to the floor. He was curled up in just the same position as they had found him in when she and the -rat--catcher, Sutton, had pried open the trapdoor.<br><br>Without debating with herself anymore, Hester went into the room and picked up the blankets, placing them over him and tucking them in lightly. Then she stood watching him. He whimpered again, and pulled at the sheet as if he were cold. She could see in the faint glow of the gaslight that he was still dreaming. His face was tight, eyes closed hard, jaw so clenched he must have been grinding his teeth. Every now and again his body moved, his hands coming up as if to reach for something.<br><br>How could she wake him without robbing him of his pride? He would never forgive her for treating him like a child. And yet his cheeks were smooth, his neck so slender and his shoulders so narrow that there was nothing of the man in him yet. He said he was eleven, but he looked about nine.<br><br>What lie would he not see through? She could not waken him without tacitly admitting that she had heard him crying in his dream. She turned and walked back to the door and went a little way along the passage. Then a better idea came to her. She tiptoed downstairs to the kitchen and poured a glass of milk. Then she took four cookies and put them on a plate. She went back upstairs, careful not to trip over her nightgown. Just before she reached his room, she deliberately banged the door of the linen cupboard. She knew it might waken Monk as well, but that could not be helped.<br><br>When she reached Scuff's room, he was lying in bed with the blankets up to his chin, fingers gripping them, eyes wide open.<br><br>"You awake too?" she said, as if mildly surprised. "So am I. I've got some milk and cookies. Would you like half?" She held up the plate.<br><br>He nodded. He could see there was only one glass, but the milk did not matter. It was the chance to be awake and not alone that he wanted.<br><br>She came in, leaving the door ajar, and sat on the edge of the bed. She put the glass on the table beside him and the plate on the blankets.<br><br>He picked up a biscuit and nibbled it, watching her. His eyes were wide and dark in the low lamplight, waiting for her to say something.<br><br>"I don't like being awake at this time of the night," she said, biting her lip a little. "I'm not -really hungry; it just feels nice to eat something. Have the milk if you want it."<br><br>"I'll take 'alf," he said. Food was precious; he was always fair<br><br>about it.<br><br>She smiled. "Good enough," she agreed, picking up a biscuit herself so he would feel comfortable eating.<br><br>He reached for the glass, holding it with both hands. He drank some, then looked at it to measure his share, drank a little more, then handed it to her. He sat very upright in the bed, his hair tousled and a rim of white on his upper lip.<br><br>She wanted to hold him, but she knew better. He might have wanted it too, but he would never have allowed such an admission. It would mean he was dependent, and he could not afford that. He had lived in the docks, scavenging for pieces of coal off the barges, brass screws, and other small valuable objects that had fallen off boats into the Thames mud. The low tide allowed boys like -him--mudlarks--to survive. He had a mother somewhere, but perhaps she had too many younger children, and neither the time nor room to care for him. Or maybe she had a new husband who did not want another man's son in the house. Boys like himself had been his friends, sharing food, warmth, and one another's pain, comrades in survival.<br><br>"Have another biscuit," Hester offered.<br><br>"I've 'ad two," he pointed out. "That was 'alf."<br><br>"Yes, I know. I took more than I wanted," she replied. "I thought I was hungry, but now I'm just awake."<br><br>He looked at her carefully, deciding if she meant it, then took the last biscuit and ate it in three mouthfuls.<br><br>She smiled at him, and after a moment he smiled back.<br><br>"Are you sleepy?" she asked.<br><br>"No_._._."<br><br>"Nor am I." She hitched herself up a little so she could sit on the bed with her head against the headboard beside him, but still keeping a distance away. "Sometimes when I'm awake I read, but I haven't got a good book at the moment. The newspaper's full of all sorts of things I don't -really want to know."<br><br>"Like wot?" he asked, twisting round so he was facing her a little more, settling in for a conversation.<br><br>She listed off a few social events she remembered, adding where they had been held and who had attended. Neither of them cared, but it was something to say. Presently she wandered off the subject and remembered past events, describing clothes and food, then behavior, wit, flirting, disasters, anything to keep him entertained. She even recalled the chaotic remembrance service where her friend Rose had been hopelessly and unintentionally drunk; she had climbed onto the stage and seized the violin from the very earnest young lady who had been playing it, and had then given her own rendition of several current music hall songs, growing bawdier with each.<br><br>Scuff giggled, trying to picture it in his mind. "Were it terrible?" he asked.<br><br>"Ghastly," Hester affirmed with relish. "She told them all the truth of what a fearful person the dead man had been, and why they had - really come. It was awful then, but I laugh every time I think of it now."<br><br>"She were yer friend." He said the word slowly, tasting its value.<br><br>"Yes," she agreed.<br><br>"D'yer 'elp 'er?"<br><br>"As much as I could."<br><br>"Fig were my friend," he said very quietly. "I din't 'elp 'im. Nor the other neither."<br><br>"I know." She felt the lump, hard and painful, in her throat. Fig was one of the boys Jericho Phillips had murdered. "I'm sorry," she whispered.<br><br>"Yer can't 'elp it," he said reasonably. "Yer did yer best. No one can stop it." He moved an inch or two closer to her. "Tell me some more about Rose and the others."<br><br>She had seen survivor's guilt before. In her nursing in the Crimea she had heard soldiers cry out from the same nightmares and had seen them waken with the same shocked and helpless eyes, staring at the comfort around them, and feeling the horror inside.<br><br>She tried to think of something else to say to Scuff, happy things, anything to take away his memory of his own lost friends, adding a little more until she looked at him and saw his eyes closing. She lowered her voice, and then lowered it even more. He was so close to her now that he was touching her. She could feel the warmth of him through the sheet that separated them. A few minutes later he was asleep. Without being aware of it he had put his head against her shoulder. She stopped talking and lay still. It was a little cramped, but she did not move until morning, when she pretended to have been asleep also.<br><br>After a breakfast of hot porridge, toast, and marmalade, Monk sent Scuff out on an errand and turned to Hester.<br><br>"Nightmares again?" he asked.<br><br>"Sorry," she apologized. "I knew I'd probably waken you, but I - couldn't leave him alone. I banged the door so-"<br><br>"You don't need to explain." He cut across her. The ghost of a smile softened the angular planes of his face for a moment, and then it was gone again. He looked grim, full of a pain he did not know how to deal with.<br><br>She knew he was remembering the terrible night on the river when Jericho Phillips had kidnapped Scuff to prevent Monk from completing the case against him, for which he would have assuredly hanged. Phillips had so very nearly succeeded. Had it not been for Sutton's little dog, Snoot, they would never have found the boy.<br><br>"He's still afraid," she said quietly. "He knows Phillips is -dead-- he saw the drowned body in the -cage--but there are other people doing the same thing, other boats on the river that use boys for pornography and -prostitution--boys just like him, his friends. People we can't help. I don't know what to say to him, because he's far too clever to believe comforting lies. And I don't want to lie to him anyway. Then he'd never trust me in anything. I wish he -didn't care about them so much, and yet I'd hate it if he could feel safe only by never looking back. He thinks we can't help." She blinked hard. "William, parents ought to be able to help. That's part of what they are for. He sees us not even trying, just accepting defeat. He - doesn't even understand why he feels so guilty, and thinks he's betraying them by being all right. He won't believe that we don't secretly think the same of him, whatever we say."<br><br>"I know." He took a deep breath and let it out slowly. "And that isn't the only problem."<br><br>She waited, her heart pounding. They had avoided saying it; all their time and emotion was concentrated on Scuff. But she had known it would have to come. Now she looked at the lines of strain in Monk's face, the shadows around his eyes, the lean, high cheekbones. There was a vulnerability there that only she understood.<br><br>She thought of Oliver Rathbone, who had been both Monk's friend and hers for so long, and beside whom they had fought desperate battles for justice, often at the risk of their reputations, even their lives. They had sat up for endless nights searching for answers, had faced victory and disaster together, horrors of grief, pity, and disillusion. Rathbone had once loved Hester, but she had chosen Monk. Then he had married Margaret Ballinger and found a happiness far better suited to his nature. Margaret could give him children, but more obvious than that, she was socially his equal. She was of a calmer, more judicious nature than Hester; she knew how to behave as Lady Rathbone, wife of the most gifted barrister in London, should.<br><br>Was it -really conceivable that Margaret's father had been the power and the money behind Jericho Phillips's abominations? That is what Lord Justice Sullivan had claimed, right before his terrible suicide at Execution Dock. Hester longed for Monk to tell her that it was not true.<br><br>"You heard what Rathbone said about Arthur Ballinger and Phillips?" Monk said.<br><br>"Yes. Has he said anything more?"<br><br>"No. I suppose there's nothing legal, or he would have. He'd have no choice."<br><br>"You mean there's no proof, just Sullivan's -word--and he's dead anyway?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"But you believe it?" That also was not -really a question.<br><br>"Of course I do," he said very softly. "Rathbone believes it, and do you think he would if there were any way in heaven or hell that he could avoid it?"<br><br>Monk lifted up his hand and touched Hester's cheek so softly, she felt the warmth of him more than the brush of his skin against hers.<br><br>"I have to know if Ballinger was involved, for Scuff, so at least he knows I'm trying," he continued. "And Rathbone has to know too, however much he would prefer not to."<br><br>"Are you going to speak to him?"<br><br>"I've been avoiding it, and so has he. He's been in court on another case for the last two weeks, but it's finished now and I can't put it off any longer."<br><br>"Are you sure he needs to know?" she pressed. "The pain of it would be intolerable, and he would have no choice but to do something about it."<br><br>"That's not like you," he said ruefully.<br><br>"To want to avoid someone else's pain?" She was momentarily indignant.<br><br>"To be evasive," he corrected her. "You are too good a nurse to want to put a bandage on something that you know needs surgery. If it's gangrene, you must take off the arm, or the patient will die. You taught me that."<br><br>"Am I being a coward?" She winced as she said the word. She knew that to a soldier, "coward" was the worst word in any language, worse even than "cheat" or "thief."</p><h2>Lady of the Lotus-Born: The Life and Enlightenment of Yeshe Tsogyal</h2><p>The first Tibetan to attain complete enlightenment was in all probability the woman Yeshe Tsogyal, the closest disciple of Padmasambhava, the master who brought Buddhism to Tibet in the eighth century. This classical text is not only a biography but also an inspiring example of how the Buddha's teaching can be put into practice. <i>Lady of the Lotus-Born </i> interweaves profound Buddhist teachings with a colorful narrative that includes episodes of adventure, court intrigue, and personal searching. The book will appeal to students of Tibetan Buddhism and readers interested in the role of women in Buddhism and world religions.</p><p>The Padmakara Translation Group, based in France, has a distinguished reputation for all its translations of Tibetan texts and teachings. Its work has been published in several languages and is renowned for its clear and accurate literary style.In the eighth century, the Indian master Padmasambhava (known as the "Lotus-Born" Guru) introduced Buddhism into Tibet. One of his first disciples, and the closest to him personally, was Yeshe Tsogyal, greatly revered by Tibetans as a NirmanakayaAan enlightened soul who returns to human life to lead others in the way of enlightenment. This is her biography, written by two of her disciples, an ancient text in a genre called namthar, a "tale of liberation." The most similar genre in the West is early hagiographyAChristian saints' lives as written by their disciples, full of effusive praise, virtuous deeds, and miracles. The Padmakara Translation Group specializes in translating important Tibetan texts into European languages. They have included an informative introduction, notes, and glossary. Though the translation is clear and readable, Lady of the Lotus-Born will reward students and scholars rather than the casual browser. Recommended for academic libraries.AJames F.

When congregational leaders are sensitive to the ways that information should be shared, the congregation can become safe and strong. Unfortunately, congregations can easily fall into patterns of communication that lead to disastrous interpersonal and organizational outcomes. Even in times of crisis, however, congregations can learn and practice new skills and healthy communication management. Congregational consultants Kibbie Ruth and Karen McClintock show clergy and laity how to appropriately handle information. From proper ways to respond to rumors to relating information about a staff firing to the congregation, Healthy Disclosure is filled with step-by-step ideas for handling different types of sensitive material. It helps clergy and other congregational leaders understand levels of disclosure, including how and when to reveal information, the difference between privacy and secrecy, legal issues related to public knowledge, and the power of secrets from a congregation&#39;s past. What we don&#39;t know can hurt us. The more conscious congregational leaders are of the information they have and how they pass it along to others, the better off the congregation will be. Information management is both a technical process and a spiritual undertaking. Leaders need the ability to spiritually discern, not just intellectually decide, the solutions to congregational dilemmas. Ruth and McClintock guide readers in developing the skills needed to create a congregational environment of healthy disclosure.</p><p>For two decades, Kibbie Ruth has taught abuse prevention and intervention strategies, and consulted on cases throughout the country. She works with judicatories and congregations to establish safe relationships and prevent child abuse, domestic violence, elder abuse, sexual harassment, professional misconduct and other abuses of power. Karen A. McClintock is a clinical psychologist and clergy person in the United Methodist Church. A nationally known lecturer and consultant on sexuality issues in the church, she is the author of Preventing Sexual Abuse in Congregations: A Resource for Leaders.In this commonsense, rational, well-researched, and down-to-earth book, Kibbie Ruth and Karen McClintock have taken the dreadful menace out of secrets and their disclosure. It is a helpful manual for everyday congregational management and thoughtful, faithful community development --Speed B.

But it didn&#x2019;t start out that way. In this thorough account of one of cinema&#x2019;s most lasting works, Michael Kaminski presents the true history of how Star Wars was written, from its beginnings as a science fiction fairy tale to its development over three decades into the epic we now know, chronicling the methods, techniques, thought processes, and struggles of its creator.

In this informally discursive introduction to St. Thomas Aquinas, Ralph McInerny shows how this basic assumption contrasts with dominant modern alternative views and is developed by Thomas into a coherent view of ourselves, of knowledge, and of God. McInerny first places Thomism in context within philosophical inquiry, discussing the relationship between philosophy and theology, and between modern and classical views of philosophy. He then describes the challenges Thomas faced with the introduction of Aristotle&#x2019;s works into the Christian West. The reader is subsequently guided through such key concepts as art, nature, causes, and motion and shown how Thomas used these concepts to resolve the problems presented by Aristotle. Each chapter is tied to a specific Thomistic text, providing a sample from a number of Thomas&#x2019;s works.</p><p>Ralph McInerny (1929&#x2013;2010) was Michael P.

But only this book provides a powerful and detailed look at the complex relationships shared between the three women who were not born Kennedy but who married into the family: Jackie Bouvier, Ethel Skakel, and Joan Bennett. <br><br>For each of the Kennedy wives, the Camelot years provided an entirely different experience of life lessons. These were the years when Jackie's dreams became reality, but at a hefty price. For Ethel, these were years of frustration where her dreams of being First Lady were dashed and she sank into a deep depression. For Joan, her years as a Kennedy wife were the most confusing of her life, and she is now a recovering alcoholic. <br><br> This fascinating story is set against a panorama of explosive American history, as the women cope with Jack's and Bobby's alleged affairs with Marilyn Monroe, their tragic assassinations, and other tragedies and scandals. Whether dealing with their husbands' blatant infidelities, stumping for their many political campaigns, touring the world to promote their family's legacy or raising their children, the Kennedy wives did it all with grace, style, and dignity. In the end, <i>Jackie, Ethel, Joan</i> is a story of redemption and great courage.</p><p>What a great idea for a deep-dish tell-all! JFK's lonely, classy wife, Bobby's athletic, competitive wife, and Ted's meek, alcoholic wife, together at last between covers, soothing each other when not fighting like fishwives. Taraborrelli's breathless prose makes you a fly on the wall when formidable mother-in-law Rose Kennedy walks in on Joan commiserating with Ethel about their honeymoons: "I think Bobby was finished before I got into the room!" said Ethel. "Now what are you ladies talking about?" asked Rose. Jackie, who was present, cooed, "Oh, we were just saying how well Bobby sleeps at night." "He gets that from me," said Rose.<p> Ethel should never have been so catty when gentle, simple Joan joined the clan: "Goodbye wine and cheese," hissed Ethel. "Hello macaroni and cheese." And she shouldn't have mocked Jackie for being unable to compete in touch football--with the Kennedys, it was more like "claw, scratch and bite" football. And what about when she rubbed it in that she and Bobby were closer than Jackie and Jack? After all, when Lee Remick phoned Ethel to say "You're on the way out," and Ethel replied that Bobby was home in bed, Bobby was in fact (says Taraborrelli) in bed with Lee Remick.</p><p> You may have heard that JFK's dad, Joe Kennedy, offered Jackie $1 million not to divorce JFK, but did you hear Jackie's alleged reply? "The price goes up to $20 million if Jack brings home any venereal diseases." Did Ethel betray Jackie's discontent to Joe--and then go ballistic when Joe only gave Ethel $500,000? You'd think Joan would be the clinker in the group, like Zeppo Marx. She was a bit dim, but should Ted have put her down as dumb? He's the one who showed up soused with a prostitute for dinner with the king and queen of Belgium, whose priceless antique couch Ted's date ruined by wetting it.</p><p> Who knows how historians will judge this book, but it sure does a great job of making history into a Jackie Collins novel. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>J.

Soon there would be nothing left to say she had ever dwelt here. <p>"It is difficult to bid farewell, domina," Drogo said with sympathy. </p><p>Still looking around, as if her gaze were caught in a web of invisible threads, Matilda paused at the door. She remembered being eight years old, standing in the great hall at Li�ge, trembling with exhaustion at the end of her long journey from England. She could still recall the fear she had felt and all the pressure of being sent out of the nest to a foreign land and a betrothal with a grown man. The match had been arranged to suit her father's political purpose and she had known she must do her duty and not incur his displeasure by failing him, because he was a great king and she was a princess of high and royal blood. It could have been a disaster but, instead, it had been the making of her: the frightened, studious little girl had been moulded into a regal woman and an able consort for the Emperor of Germany. </p><p>"I have been happy here." She touched the carved doorpost in a gesture that clung and bade farewell at the same time. "Your lord father will be pleased to have you home." </p><p>Matilda dropped her hand and straightened her cloak. "I do not need to be cajoled like a skittish horse." </p><p>"That was not my intent, domina." </p><p>"Then what was your intent?" Drogo had been with her since that first long journey to her betrothal. He was her bodyguard and leader of her household knights: strong, dour, dependable. As a child she had thought him ancient because even then his hair had been white, although he had only been thirty years old. He looked little different now, except for a few new lines and the deepening of older ones. </p><p>"To say that an open door awaits you." </p><p>"And that I should close this one?" </p><p>"No, domina, it has made you who and what you are-and that is also why your father has summoned you." </p><p>"It is but one of his reasons and driven by necessity," she replied shortly. "I may not have seen my father in many years, but I know him well." Taking a resolute breath, she left the room, carrying herself as if she were bearing the weight and grace of her crown. </p><p>Her entourage awaited her in a semi-circle of servants, retainers, and officials. Most of her baggage had gone ahead by cart three days earlier and only the nucleus of her household remained with a handful of packhorses to carry light provisions and the items she wanted to keep with her. Her chaplain, Burchard, kept looking furtively at the gelding laden with the items from the portable chapel. Matilda followed his glance, her gaze resting but not lingering upon a certain leather casket in one of the panniers, before she turned to her mare. The salmon-red saddle was a sumptuous affair, padded and brocaded almost like her hearth chair, with a support for her spine and a rest for her feet. While not the swiftest way to travel, it was dignified and magnificent. The towns and villages through which they passed would expect nothing less than splendour from the emperor's recent widow. </p><p>Matilda mounted up, settling herself and positioning her feet precisely on the platform. Seated sideways, looking both forward and back. It was appropriate. She raised her slender right hand to Drogo, who acknowledged the signal with a salute and trotted to the head of the troop. The banners unfurled, gold and red and black, the heralds cantered out, and the cavalcade began to unwind along the road like jewels knotted on a string. The dowager empress of Germany was leaving the home of her heart to return to the home of her birth and a new set of duties. </p><p>Adeliza gripped the bedclothes and stifled a gasp as Henry withdrew from her body. He was approaching sixty years old, but still hale and vigorous. The force of his thrusts had made her sore inside, and his stolid weight was crushing her into the bed. Mercifully, he gathered himself and flopped over on to his back, panting hard. Biting her lip, Adeliza placed her hand on her flat belly and strove to regain her own breath. Henry was well endowed, and the act of procreation was often awkward and uncomfortable between them but, God willing, this time she would conceive. </p><p>She had been Henry's wife and the consecrated queen of England for over four years, and still each month her flux came at the appointed time in a red cramp of disappointment and failure. Thus far no amount of prayers, gifts, penances, or potions had rectified her barrenness. Henry had a score of bastards by various mistresses, so he was potent with other women, but only had one living legitimate child, his daughter Matilda from his first marriage. His son from that union had died shortly before Henry took Adeliza to wife. He seldom spoke of the tragedy that had robbed him of his heir, drowned in a shipwreck on a bitter November night, but it had driven his policies ever since. Her part in those policies was to bear him a new male heir, but thus far she had failed in her duty. Henry kissed her shoulder and squeezed her breast before parting the curtains and leaving the bed. She watched him scratch the curly silver hair on his broad chest. His stocky frame carried a slight paunch, but he was muscular and in proportion. </p><p>Stretching, he made a sound like a contented lion. Their union, she thought, even if it brought forth no other fruit, had released his tension. His sexual appetite was prodigious and in between bedding her, he regularly sported with other women. </p><p>He poured himself wine from the flagon set on a painted coffer under the window, and on his return picked up his cloak and swept it around his shoulders. Silver and blue squirrel furs gleamed in the candlelight. Adeliza sat up and folded her hands around her knees. The soreness between her thighs diminished to a dull throb. He offered her a drink from the cup and she took a dainty sip. "Matilda will be arriving soon," he said. "Brian FitzCount is due to meet her tomorrow on the road." </p><p>Adeliza could tell from his expression that his thoughts had turned inwards to the weaving of his political web. "All is ready for her," she replied. "The servants are keeping a good fire in her chamber to make it warm and chase out the damp. I have instructed them to burn incense and put out bowls of rose petals to sweeten the air. They hung new tapestries on the walls this afternoon and the furniture is all assembled. I..." </p><p>Henry raised his hand to silence her. "I am sure her chamber will be perfect." </p><p>Adeliza flushed and looked down. </p><p>"I think you will be good company for each other, being of a similar age." Henry gave her a slightly condescending smile. </p><p>"It will be strange to call her daughter when she is older than me." </p><p>"I am sure you will both quickly grow accustomed." He was still smiling, but Adeliza could tell his attention lay elsewhere. Henry's conversations were never just idle gossip; there was always a purpose. "I want you to cultivate her. She has been a long time absent, and I need to consider her future. Some matters are rightly for the council chamber and for father and daughter, but some things are better discussed between women." He stroked the side of her face with a powerful, stubby hand. "You have a skill with people; they open themselves to you." </p><p>Adeliza frowned. "You want me to draw confidences from her?" </p><p>"I would know her mind. I have seen her once in fifteen years, and then but for a few days. Her letters give me news, but they are couched in the language of scribes and I would know her true character." A hard glint entered his eyes. "I would know if she is strong enough." </p><p>"Strong enough for what?" </p><p>"For what I have in mind for her."</p></p><h2>Why Do Christians Shoot Their Wounded?: Helping (Not Hurting) Those with Emotional Difficulties</h2><p>It's no sin to hurt. Thousands of Christians suffer real emotional pain--such as depression, anxiety, obsessiveness. Many other Christians, including prominent leaders, believe emotional problems are the result of sin or bad choices. These attitudes often only add to the suffering of those who hurt. In this book Dwight Carlson marshals recent scientific evidence that demonstrates many emotional problems are just as physical or biological as diabetes, cancer and heart disease. While he never discounts personal responsibility, Carlson shows from both the Bible and up-to-date medicine why it really is no sin to hurt. Understandably and compellingly, <em>Why Do Christians Shoot Their Wounded?</em> brings profound help for those who hurt and those who counsel. For those who suffer, here is a powerful liberation from guilt. For those who care for the suffering, here is vivid proof that those in emotional pain deserve compassion, not condemnation.</p><p>Dwight L. Carlson, a physician and psychiatrist, lives and works in California. His many books include <em>Living God's Will</em> and <em>Run and Not Be Weary.</em>&#34;This clear and practical book rejects the idea that hurting people should be condemned for their pain, and it succeeds in equipping churches to provide more effective care for these people.&#34; (Amy Simpson, Christianity Today, January / February 2013)</p><h2>Drawing Made Easy</h2><p>Although you may never have heard of him, E. G. Lutz is the author, animator, and cartoonist who inspired a 19-year-old Walt Disney to start drawing and pursue a career in animation.

At the same time, it's not a war novel. Instead, it's a skillfully constructed literary IED that brings together the sharpest aspects from multiple genres. It's a Tarantino-esque <i>Heart of Darkness</i> set in war-torn Iraq, filled with absurdism and dark humor, a mash-up of satirical Joseph Heller-style comedy and sci-fi fantasy with a gratuitous mixture of good old-fashioned ultra-violence."

Because Thor was a real person, who appeared in a public on a few occasions (including at the United Nations headquarters in New York City), the legend of the Stranger at the Pentagon has grown, becoming a real head-scratcher for 21st-century UFO researchers. Today, it is still one of the hottest topics in ufology, having spawned various other books, documentaries, and even feature Hollywood films. <br><br> What exactly happened to Valiant Thor? Did he get back on his spaceship and return to his home planet, or did he help the U.S. government set up alien-human hybrid experimentation in remote underground bases? Or was he imprisoned - thrown in the clink - by those in the government who have been fighting UFO Disclosure all these years? <br><br> Since no one knows how long an alien can live, could Valiant Thor still be alive today, in 2016, somewhere in - or under - our nation's capitol? <br><br> This special Saucerian reprint - an exact facsimile of the original 220-page book (twice as long as the revised editions) - features an actual introduction by Valiant Thor himself, as well as dozens of interesting photos - covering years of ufological history.

"Why can't I be a knight?" <p>"Girls don't go raiding," Will answered with the superiority that came from being male, almost fourteen, and heir to the Earldom of Pembroke. </p><p>She made a grab for his horse's reins and he snatched them out of her reach. </p><p>"Girls stay at home and embroider and bear children. Only men go to war." </p><p>"Women have to defend the castle when their lords are away," she pointed out. "Mama does-and you have to obey her." Tossing her head, she looked at Richard, who was twelve and could sometimes be persuaded to take her part; but, although a broad grin sprawled across his freckled face, he didn't leap to her defence. </p><p>"She has to do our lord father's bidding when he returns," Will retorted. "Papa doesn't send her out with a lance in her hand while he stays at home, does he?" </p><p>"I can pretend; it's all pretend anyway." Mahelt was determined not to be bettered. "You're not a man." </p><p>Richard's grin widened as Will flushed. "Let her defend the castle," he said. "She might have to do it one day when she's married." </p><p>Will rolled his eyes, but gave in. "All right, but she's not a knight, and she's not riding Equus." </p><p>"Of course not." </p><p>"And she can be the French. We're the English." </p><p>"That's not fair!" Mahelt protested again. </p><p>"Don't play then," Will said indifferently. </p><p>She shot her brothers a fulminating look. She wanted to ride Will's new mount because it was a proper, big, glossy horse, not a pony. She wanted to jump him over hedges as Will did and see how fast she could make him gallop. She wanted to feel the wind in her hair. Will had called him Equus, which he said was the Latin name the scribes wrote meaning "warhorse." Richard's docile grey wasn't the same challenge, and she had almost outgrown her own dumpy little chestnut, which was stabled up with a leg strain. She knew she could ride as well as either of her brothers. </p><p>Heaving a sigh, she stumped off with bad grace to defend the "castle," which for the purposes of the game was the kennelkeeper's hut. Here were stored the collars and leashes for the hounds, old blankets, hunting horns, various tools, baskets, and bowls. A shelf at Mahelt's eye level held chubby earthenware pots of salve for treating canine injuries. Mahelt took one down, removed the lid of plaited straw, and immediately recoiled from the vile stench of rancid goose grease. </p><p>"Ready?" she heard Richard shout. </p><p>Her left arm crooked around the pot, Mahelt emerged from the shed and, with a resolute jaw, faced the youths, who were fretting their mounts. Both boys bore makeshift lances fashioned from ash staves, and gripped their practice shields at the ready. </p><p>Uttering simultaneous yells, the brothers charged. Knowing they expected her to lose her courage and dash back inside the shed, Mahelt stood her ground. She scooped up a handful of grease, feeling it cold and squidgy-soft between her fingers, and lobbed it at the oncoming horses. Will ducked behind his shield, which took the first impact, but Mahelt's next dollop struck him over the rawhide rim, splattering his cloak and the side of his neck. Another scoop burst on the shoulder of Richard's grey. His efforts to control his shying mount left him exposed and her fourth handful landed a direct hit to his face. </p><p>"Hah! You're both dead!" She leaped gleefully up and down. </p><p>"I win, I win!" Triumph burned in her solar plexus. That was showing them. </p><p>Will was off his horse like lightning. Mahelt shrieked and tried to run inside the shed, but he was too fast and caught her arm. She spun round in his grip and struck his chest with her salve-covered hand, smearing his cloak with rancid grease. </p><p>"It's dishonourable to hit a lady!" she cried as he raised a threatening fist. </p><p>Will looked at his bunched knuckles and, lowering his arm, gave her a disgusted shove instead. "Look what you've done to my cloak! I pity whoever gets you to wife. You're a hoyden." Mahelt raised her chin, determined not to show remorse or be browbeaten. "But I still won," she said. "Against both of you." </p><p>"Will, leave her," Richard said with exasperation, wiping his face. "Let's go. There are better places to practise. We'd get more hurled at us in a real battle than handfuls of old grease." </p><p>With a final glare, Will flung round and remounted Equus. "It looks as if you've lost after all," he said as he gathered his reins. </p><p>Through a blur of angry tears she watched her brothers ride away. Raising her hand to wipe her eyes, she found the stink of the salve on her fingers suddenly unbearable. She was cold, hungry, and empty. Her victory was a hollow one and she was going to be in trouble for wasting the hound-keeper's salve and dirtying her brothers' clothes. She returned the pot to its shelf and closed the shed door. When she turned round, she jumped, because Godfrey, her father's under-chamberlain, was standing behind her. "Your parents are seeking you, young mistress." He wrinkled his nose. "God's eyes, what have you been doing?" </p><p>"Nothing." She gave him an imperious look to cloak her guilt. "Defending the castle." </p><p>Godfrey said nothing, but his gaze was eloquent. </p><p>"What do they want?" Facing both parents at once was generally reserved for serious misdemeanours. Her mother had eyes in the back of her head, but surely she couldn't know about the grease-throwing yet and Mahelt couldn't think of anything else she had done recently to warrant such a command. </p><p>"I do not know, young mistress. Your lady mother just said to fetch you." </p><p>Decidedly on her guard, Mahelt followed him to the solar, pausing on the way to sluice her hands in the trough and wipe them on a net of hay tied to the stable wall. </p><p>Her mother and father were sitting before the hearth in their private chamber, and she saw a glance flicker between them as she entered. She could sense an atmosphere, but it wasn't angry. Gilbert and Walter, her two younger brothers, were playing a dice game on the floor and a nurse was attending to her little sisters, Belle aged four, and two-year-old Sybire. </p><p>Her mother patted the bench and Mahelt came to sit in the space her parents had made for her between them. The fire embraced her with warmth. The hangings were drawn across the window shutters and the mellow glow from numerous beeswax candles made the room feel cosy and welcoming. Her mother smelled wonderfully of roses and the arm she slipped around Mahelt to cuddle her was tender and maternal. Mahelt decided her brothers were welcome to their silly game. Parental attention was better, especially if she wasn't in trouble. She thought it odd that her father was holding her floppy cloth doll in his big hands and looking at it in a pensive manner. Seeing her watching him, he put it down and smiled, but his eyes were serious. </p><p>"You remember a few weeks ago, the Christmas court at Canterbury?" he asked. </p><p>She nodded. "Yes, Papa." It had been lovely-all the feasting and dancing and celebration. She had felt so grown up, being allowed to mingle with the adults. She had been wary of King John because she knew her mother disliked him, but she thought the jewels he wore around his neck were magnificent. Sapphires and rubies, so her cousin Ela had said, all the way from Sarandib. </p><p>"You remember Hugh Bigod?" </p><p>"Yes, Papa." The heat from the fire was suddenly hot on her face. She picked up her doll and began fussing with it herself. Hugh was grown up, but he had partnered her in a circle dance, clasping her hand and winding her through the chain. Later he had organised games of hoodman blind and hunt the slipper for the younger ones, joining in himself with great enthusiasm. He had a rich singing voice and a smile that made her stomach flutter, although she didn't know why. One day he would be Earl of Norfolk.</p></p><h2>My Cousin, My Gastroenterologist: A novel</h2><p>Welcome to Mark Leyner&#x2019;s America, where you can order gallium arsenide sushi at a roadside diner, get loaded on a cocktail of growth hormones and anabolic steroids, and support your habit by appearing on TV game shows.

In his seminal study <i>Christianity as Mystical Fact</i> he turned his esoteric genius to interpreting the Christ event as the turning point in the world's spiritual history&#x2015;an incarnation whose significance he saw transcending all religions.&#x201d; <p>&#x2015;<b>Bishop Frederick H. Borsch,</b> professor of New Testament and chair of Anglican Studies, Lutheran Theological Seminary, Philadelphia</p><br>&#x201c;As simultaneously mysticism and fact, Christianity is a breakthrough in the historical development of humanity for which the mysteries, with the results that they brought about, form a prior evolutionary stage.&#x201d; &#x2015;<b>Rudolf Steiner</b> <br><br>During the fall and winter of 1901&#x2013;1902, Steiner gave a series of lectures called &#x201c;Christianity As Mystical Fact&#x201d; to members of the Theosophical Society. The lectures were rewritten and issued as a book later that year. They mark a watershed in the development of Western esotericism. Steiner wrote of the idea behind his book: <br><br>&#x201c;The title <i>Christianity As Mystical Fact</i> was one I gave to this work eight years ago, when I gathered together the content of lectures given in 1902. It was meant to indicate the special approach adopted in the book. Its theme is not just the mystical side of Christianity in a historical presentation. It was meant to show, from the standpoint of a mystical awareness, how Christianity came into being. <br><br>Behind this was the idea that spiritual happenings were factors in the emergence of Christianity, which could only be observed from such a point of view. It is for the book itself to demonstrate that, by "mystical,&#x201d; I do not in any way imply a vague intuition rather than strict scientific argument. In many circles, mysticism is understood as just that, and therefore it is distinguished from the concerns of all 'genuine' science. <br><br>&#x201c;In this book, however, I use the term to mean a 'presentation of spiritual reality'&#x2015;a reality accessible only to a knowledge drawn from the sources of spiritual life itself.

As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.</p><h2>Born Evil: A True Story of Cannibalism and Serial Murder</h2><p><p>Homeless and living in his truck, forty-year-old Hadden Clark often drew stares in Bethesda, Maryland. He also slept with a teddy bear, and, dressed as a woman, strolling through town, he carried 28 carving knives, a straight razor, and a gun in his truck. When the reclusive loner was arrested in 1992 for the stabbing murders of two local girls, no one was surprised. It was after his incarceration that the surprises came, popping up like half-buried corpses.</p><p>While serving a seventy-year sentence, Hadden confessed to having a split personality, dominated by a psychotic mother and daughter who were vying for attention. He also admitted to murdering at least a dozen more women-- the ones he could remember-- cannibalizing them, using their leftover body parts as fishing bait, and burying their remains everywhere from a local cemetery to a sand dune on Cape Cod. Authorities didn't believe him-- until Hadden took them on a personal four-state tour.</p><p>Adrian Havill's <i>Born Evil </i>is a terrifying true crime story of split personalities, cannibalism and serial murder.</p></p><p><p><b>Adrian Havill</b> is the author of <i>While Innocents Slept, Born Evil</i> and <i>The Mother, The Son, And the Socialite: The True Story of a Mother-Son Crime</i>.

The blood and the gore of it, the ferocity of its glee. It had come to this place with the wilful temper of a child, full of heat and passion and careless brutality.&#39; In an uptown strip joint a cop is found bludgeoned to death. The weapon&#39;s a baseball bat. The motive is a mystery. It&#39;s a case of serious overkill that pushes Eve Dallas straight into overdrive. Her investigation uncovers a private club that&#39;s more than a hot spot. Purgatory&#39;s a last chance for atonement where everyone is judged. Where your ultimate fate depends on your most intimate sins. And where one cop&#39;s hidden secrets are about to plunge innocent souls into vice-ridden damnation.</p><p>J. D.

The blood and the gore of it, the ferocity of its glee. It had come to this place with the willful temper of a child, full of heat and passion and careless brutality.</p><p>Murder was rarely a tidy business. Whether it was craftily calculated or wildly impulsive, it tended to leave a mess for others to clean up.</p><p>It was her job to wade through the debris of murder, to pick up the pieces, see where they fit, and put together a picture of the life that had been stolen. And through that picture to find the image of a killer.</p><p>Now, in the early hours of morning, in the hesitant spring of 2059, her boots crunched over a jagged sea of broken glass. Her eyes, brown and cool, scanned the scene: shattered mirrors, broken bottles, splintered wood. Wall screens were smashed, privacy booths scarred and dented. Pricey leather and cloth that had covered stools or the plusher seating areas had been ripped to colorful shreds.</p><p>What had once been an upscale strip club was now a jumbled pile of expensive garbage.</p><p>What had once been a man lay behind the wide curve of the bar. Now a victim, sprawled in his own blood.</p><p>Lieutenant Eve Dallas crouched beside him. She was a cop, and that made him hers.</p><p>&#x201c;Male. Black. Late thirties. Massive trauma, head and body. Multiple broken bones.&#x201d; She took a gauge from her field kit to take the body and ambient temperatures. &#x201c;Looks like the fractured skull would have done the job, but it didn&#x2019;t stop there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He was beaten to pieces.&#x201d;</p><p>Eve acknowledged her aide&#x2019;s comment with a grunt. She was looking at what was left of a well-built man in his prime, a good six-two and two hundred and thirty pounds of what had been toned muscle.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you see, Peabody?&#x201d;</p><p>Automatically, Peabody shifted her stance, focused her vision. &#x201c;The victim.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, it appears the victim was struck from behind. The first blow probably took him down, or at least dazed him. The killer followed through, with repeated strikes. From the pattern of the blood splatter, and brain matter, he was taken out with head shots, then beaten while down, likely unconscious. Some of the injuries were certainly delivered postmortem. The metal bat is the probable murder weapon and was used by someone of considerable strength, possibly chemically induced, as the scene indicates excessive violence often demonstrated by users of Zeus.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Time of death, oh four hundred,&#x201d; Eve stated, then turned her head to look up at Peabody.</p><p>Her aide was starched and pressed and as official as they came, with her uniform cap set precisely on her dark chin-length hair. She had good eyes, Eve thought, clear and dark. And though the sheer vileness of the scene had leached some of the color from her cheeks, she was holding.</p><p>&#x201c;Motive?&#x201d; Eve asked.</p><p>&#x201c;It appears to be robbery, Lieutenant.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The cash drawer&#x2019;s open and empty. The credit machine&#x2019;s broken.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mmm-hmm. Snazzy place like this would be heavier in credits, but they&#x2019;d do some cash business.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Zeus addicts kill for spare change.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;True enough. But what would our victim have been doing alone, in a closed club, with an addict? Why would he let anyone hopped on Zeus behind the bar? And&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; With her sealed fingers she picked up a small silver credit chip from the river of blood. &#x201c;Why would our addict leave these behind? A number of them are scattered here around the body.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He could have dropped them.&#x201d; But Peabody began to think she wasn&#x2019;t seeing something Eve did.</p><p>&#x201c;Could have.&#x201d;</p><p>She counted the coins as she picked them up, thirty in all, sealed them in an evidence bag, and handed it to Peabody. Then she picked up the bat. It was fouled with blood and brain. About two feet in length, she judged, and weighted to mean business.</p><p>Mean business.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s good, solid metal, not something an addict would pick up in some abandoned building. We&#x2019;re going to find this belonged here, behind the bar. We&#x2019;re going to find, Peabody, that our victim knew his killer. Maybe they were having an after-hours drink.&#x201d;</p><p>Her eyes narrowed as she pictured it. &#x201c;Maybe they had words, and the words escalated. More likely, our killer already had an edge on. He knew where the bat was. Came behind the bar. Something he&#x2019;d done before, so our friend here doesn&#x2019;t think anything of it. He&#x2019;s not concerned, doesn&#x2019;t worry about turning his back.&#x201d;</p><p>She did so herself, measuring the position of the body, of the splatter. &#x201c;The first blow rams him face first into the glass on the back wall. Look at the cuts on his face. Those aren&#x2019;t nicks from flying glass. They&#x2019;re too long, too deep. He manages to turn, and that&#x2019;s where the killer takes the next swing here, across the jaw. That spins him around again. He grabs the shelves there, brings them down. Bottles crashing. That&#x2019;s when he took the killing blow. This one that cracked his skull like an egg.&#x201d;</p><p>She crouched again, sat back on her heels. &#x201c;After that, the killer just beat the hell out of him, then wrecked the place. Maybe in temper, maybe as cover. But he had enough control to come back here, to look at his handiwork before he left. He dropped the bat here when he was done.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He wanted it to look like a robbery? Like an illegals overkill?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. Or our victim was a moron and I&#x2019;m giving him too much credit. You got the body and immediate scene recorded? All angles?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s turn him over.&#x201d;</p><p>The shattered bones shifted like a sack of broken crockery as Eve turned the body. &#x201c;Goddamn it. Oh, goddamn it.&#x201d;</p><p>She reached down to lift the smeared ID from the cool, congealing pool of blood. With her sealed thumb, she wiped at the photo and the shield. &#x201c;He was on the job.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He was a cop?&#x201d; Peabody stepped forward. She heard the sudden silence. The crime scene team and the sweepers working on the other side of the bar stopped talking. Stopped moving.</p><p>A half dozen faces turned. Waited.</p><p>&#x201c;Kohli, Detective Taj.&#x201d; Eve&#x2019;s face was grim as she got to her feet. &#x201c;He was one of us.&#x201d;</p><p>Peabody crossed the littered floor to where Eve stood watching the remains of Detective Taj Kohli being bagged for transferal to the morgue. &#x201c;I got his basics, Dallas. He&#x2019;s out of the One twenty-eight, assigned to Illegals. Been on the job for eight years. Came out of the military. He was thirty-seven. Married. Two kids.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Anything pop on his record?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, sir. It&#x2019;s clean.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s find out if he was working undercover here or just moonlighting. Elliott? I want those security discs.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There aren&#x2019;t any.&#x201d; One of the crime scene team hurried over. His face was folded into angry lines. &#x201c;Cleaned out. Every one of them. The place had full scope, and this son of a bitch snagged every one. We got nothing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Covered his tracks.&#x201d; With her hands on her hips, Eve turned a circle. The club was triple-leveled, with a stage on the main, dance floors on one and two. Privacy rooms ringed the top. For full scope, she estimated it would need a dozen cameras, probably more. To snag all the record discs would have taken time and care.</p><p>&#x201c;He knew the place,&#x201d; she decided. &#x201c;Or he&#x2019;s a fucking security whiz. Window dressing,&#x201d; she muttered. &#x201c;All this destruction&#x2019;s just window dressing. He knew what he was doing. He had control. Peabody, find out who owns the place, who runs it. I want to know everybody who works here. I want to know the setup.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lieutenant?&#x201d; A harassed-looking sweeper trudged through the chaos. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a civilian outside.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There are a lot of civilians outside. Let&#x2019;s keep them there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir, but this one insists on speaking to you. He says this is his place. And, ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;&nbsp;&#x2018;And, ah&#x2019; what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And that you&#x2019;re his wife.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Roarke Entertainment,&#x201d; Peabody announced as she read off the data from her palm PC. She sent Eve a cautious smile. &#x201c;Guess who owns Purgatory?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I should&#x2019;ve figured it.&#x201d; Resigned, Eve strode to the entrance door.</p><p>He looked very much as he&#x2019;d looked two hours before when they&#x2019;d parted ways to go about their individual business. Sleek and gorgeous. The light topcoat he wore over his dark suit fluttered a bit in the breeze. The same breeze that tugged at the mane of black hair that framed his poetically sinful face. The dark glasses he wore against the glare of the sun only added to the look of slick elegance.</p><p>And when he slipped them off as she stepped out, the brilliant blue of his eyes met hers. He tucked the glasses in his pocket, lifted an eyebrow.</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning, Lieutenant.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I had a bad feeling when I walked in here. It&#x2019;s just your kind of place, isn&#x2019;t it? Why do you have to own every damn thing?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was a boyhood dream.&#x201d; His voice cruised over Ireland, picked up the music of it. He glanced past her to the police seal. &#x201c;It appears we&#x2019;ve both been inconvenienced.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you have to tell the sweeper I was your wife?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You are my wife,&#x201d; he said easily and shifted his gaze back to her face. &#x201c;A fact which pleases me daily.&#x201d; He took her hand, rubbing his thumb over her wedding ring before she could tug it free again.</p><p>&#x201c;No touching,&#x201d; she hissed at him, which made him smile.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not what you said a few hours ago. In fact&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shut up, Roarke.&#x201d; She glanced around, though none of the cops working the scene was outside or close enough to hear. &#x201c;This is a police investigation.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So I&#x2019;m told.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And who told you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The head of the maintenance team who found the body. He did call the police first,&#x201d; he pointed out. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s natural he&#x2019;d report the incident to me. What happened?&#x201d;</p><p>There was no point in griping because his business had tangled around hers. Again. She tried to console herself that he could and would help her cut through some of the muck of paperwork.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you have a bartender by the name of Kohli? Taj Kohli?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have no idea. But I can find out.&#x201d; He took a slim memo book out of his breast pocket, keyed in a request for data. &#x201c;Is he dead?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As dead gets.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, he was mine,&#x201d; Roarke confirmed, and the Irish in his voice had taken on a cold note. &#x201c;For the past three months. Part time. Four nights a week. He had a family.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I know.&#x201d; Such things mattered to him, and it always touched her heart. &#x201c;He was a cop,&#x201d; Eve said. This time his brows lifted. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t have that data in your little scan, did you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. It seems my personnel director was careless. That will be fixed. Am I allowed inside?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, in a minute. How long have you owned the place?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Four years, more or less.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How many employees, full- and part-time?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get you all the data, Lieutenant, and answer all pertinent questions.&#x201d; Annoyance gleamed in his eyes as he reached for the door himself. &#x201c;But now, I&#x2019;d like to see my place.&#x201d;</p><p>He pushed inside, scanned the destruction, then focused in on the thick black bag being loaded on what the death attendants called a stroller.</p><p>&#x201c;How was he killed?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thoroughly,&#x201d; Eve said, then sighed when Roarke simply turned and stared at her. &#x201c;It was ugly, okay? Metal bat.&#x201d; She watched Roarke look toward the bar and the spray of blood sparkling on glass like an incomprehensible painting. &#x201c;After the first few hits, he wouldn&#x2019;t have felt anything.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ever had a bat laid into you? I have,&#x201d; he said before she could answer. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not pleasant. It seems far-fetched to think it&#x2019;s robbery, even one that got well out of hand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;d have been enough prime liquor, easily fenced, to keep anyone cozily fixed for some time. Why break the bottles when you could sell them? If you hit a place like this, it&#x2019;s not for the bit of cash that might be copped, but for the inventory and perhaps some of the equipment.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is that the voice of experience?&#x201d;</p><p>She teased a grin out of him. &#x201c;Naturally. My experience, that is, as a property owner and a law-abiding citizen.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Security discs?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Gone. He got all of them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then it follows he&#x2019;d cased the place carefully beforehand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How many cameras?&#x201d;</p><p>Once again, Roarke took out his pad, checked data. &#x201c;Eighteen. Nine on this floor, six on two, and the other two on the top level for full scope. Before you ask, closing is at three, which would have staff out by half past. The last show, and we&#x2019;ve live ones here, ends at two. The musicians and the entertainers&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Strippers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As you like,&#x201d; he said mildly. &#x201c;They clock off at that time. I&#x2019;ll have names and schedules for you within the hour.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Appreciate it. Why Purgatory?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The name?&#x201d; The ghost of a smile flirted with his mouth. &#x201c;I liked it. The priests will tell you Purgatory&#x2019;s a place for atonement, rehabilitation perhaps. A bit like prison. I&#x2019;ve always seen it as a last chance to be human,&#x201d; he decided. &#x201c;Before you strap on your wings and halo or face the fire.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Which would you rather?&#x201d; she wondered. &#x201c;The wings or the fire?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the point, you see. I prefer being human.&#x201d; As the stroller wheeled by, he ran a hand over her short brown hair. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry for this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So am I. Any reason a New York City detective would have been working undercover in Purgatory?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t say. It&#x2019;s certainly likely that some of the clientele might dabble in areas not strictly approved by the NYPSD, but I&#x2019;ve not been informed of anything overt. Some illegals might change hands in privacy rooms or under tables, but there&#x2019;s been no large transactions here. I would have known. The strippers don&#x2019;t turn tricks unless they&#x2019;re licensed, which some are. No one under age is allowed through the doors&#x2014;as client or staff. I have my own standards, Lieutenant, such as they are.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not coming down on you. I need a picture.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re pissed that I&#x2019;m here at all.&#x201d;</p><p>She waited a minute, her short, choppy hair disordered from its dance outside in the early breeze. As the morgue techs opened the door to transfer Kohli, the sounds of the day punched into the club.</p><p>Traffic was already thickening. Cars crammed irritably on the street, air commuters swarmed the skies. She heard the call of an early-bird glide-cart operator call to the techs and ask: &#x201c;What da fuck?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, I&#x2019;m pissed that you&#x2019;re here at all. I&#x2019;ll get over it. When&#x2019;s the last time you were in here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Months. It ran well and didn&#x2019;t need my direct attention.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who manages it for you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rue MacLean. I&#x2019;ll get her information to you as well.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sooner than later. Do you want to go through the place now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No point in it until I&#x2019;ve refreshed myself on how it was. I&#x2019;ll want to be let back in once I&#x2019;ve done that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take care of it. Yes, Peabody?&#x201d; she said, turning as her aide inched forward and cleared her throat.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry, sir, but I thought you&#x2019;d want to know I reached the victim&#x2019;s squad captain. They&#x2019;re sending a member of his unit and a counselor to inform next of kin. They need to know if they should wait for you or see the wife alone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tell them to wait.

Many of the models are official, contemporary artifacts made by the craftsmen of the Royal Navy or the shipbuilders themselves, ranging from the mid-seventeenth century to the present day. As such they represent a three-dimensional archive of unique importance and authority. Treated as historical evidence, they offer more detail than even the best plans, and demonstrate exactly what the ships looked like in a way that even the finest marine painter could not achieve. Now available in paperback, this book tells the story of the evolution of the cruising ship under sail. It includes a large number of model photos all in full-color as well as close-up and detail views. These are captioned in depth, but many are also annotated to focus attention on interesting or unusual features.<br><p>Although pictorial in emphasis, <i>The Sailing Frigate</i> weaves the pictures into an authoritative text, producing an unusual and attractive form of technical history. While the series will be of particular interest to ship modelers, all those with an interest in ship design and development will be attracted to the in-depth analysis of these beautifully presented books.</p></p><p>Robert Gardiner is the author of three books on sailing cruisers, including <i>Frigates of the Napoleonic Wars</i>, published in 2000 and re-released in paperback in 2006. His last book was a new and enlarged edition of <i>Warships of the Napoleonic Era</i>.An extensively researched book full of insight and a wealth of detail.

Many of China&#x2019;s most famous poets&#x2014;Du Fu, Li Bai, Bai Juyi, and Wang Wei&#x2014;are represented by timeless poems about love, war, the delights of drinking and dancing, and the beauties of nature. There are poems about travel, about grief, about the frustrations of bureaucracy, and about the pleasures and sadness of old age.<br><br>Full of wisdom and humanity that reach across the barriers of language, space, and time, these poems take us to the heart of Chinese poetry, and into the very heart and soul of a nation.</p><p><b>Peter Harris </b>is the founder of the Asian Studies Institute at Victoria University, Wellington, New Zealand, and the editor of the Everyman&#x2019;s Library Pocket Poets anthology <i>Zen Poems.</i>FOREWORD<br><br>The Tang dynasty (618&#x2013;907) was the golden age of Chinese poetry. Much the best-known anthology of Tang poems in Chinese is <i>Three Hundred Tang Poems</i>, and this book is a new translation of all the poems in that anthology. It includes the work of many of China&#x2019;s most admired poets, among them Du Fu and Li Bai as well as Bai Juyi, Li Shangyin andWangWei.<br><br>Compiledin the eighteenth centuryby the scholarSun Zhu, the original <i>Three Hundred Tang Poems</i> is divided up by type of poem, rather than author. There are three main types. &#x2018;Old-style poems&#x2019;, which come at the beginning of the anthology, are poems of any length. &#x2018;Regulated poems&#x2019; are eight lines long, with stricter rules about rhyme and tone, and two couplets in the middle that each have matching lines. &#x2018;Cut-off lines&#x2019;, which Sun Zhu puts at the end, are poems with just four lines each. Nearly all the poems have five or seven characters per line, with the five-character poems coming first.<br><br>Here the poems are given by poet, in alphabetical order of name in romanized (<i>pinyin</i>) form. Then under each poet the poems are all arranged by type, as in the original. (Nearly all of them, anyway&#x2014;a few have been rearranged for reasons of space.) There are some short notes at the back with explanations of names and other references.<br><br>Peter Harris</p><h2>The Trouble with Twelfth Grave: A Charley Davidson Novel (Charley Davidson Series, 12)</h2><p><p><b>Grim Reaper Charley Davidson is back in the twelfth installment of Darynda Jones&#x2019; New York Times bestselling paranormal series, <i>The Trouble with Twelfth Grave.</i></b></p><p>Charley Davidson never signed up for all this.

Grounded in the interviewing-based ethnographic technique known as ethnosemantics, the latest edition continues to treat ethnography as a discovery process. Students are taught how to set up an ethnographic field study, choose a microculture, and find and approach an informant, as well as how to ask ethnographic questions, record data, and organize and analyze what they have learned. Detailed instruction on how to write an ethnography is also provided. The guidelines are followed by ten short but substantive, well-written student ethnographies on such microcultures as exotic dancing, firefighting, pest extermination, and the work of midwives and police detectives. The Second Edition of this popular classroom volume has been expanded to include boxed inserts that offer suggestions to aid in the research process, new material on how to use observation and narratives with the ethnosemantic approach, greater emphasis on how to find cultural themes and adaptive challenges by analyzing ethnographic field data, and more extensive strategies for writing the final ethnographic paper. The latest edition also presents an expanded treatment of ethical responsibilities as well as a discussion of the significance of ethnographic research and its applications in the workplace.<p>Titles of related interest also available from Waveland Press: Angrosino, <i>Doing Cultural Anthropology: Projects for Ethnographic Data Collection,</i> Second Edition (ISBN 9781577664642); Angrosino, <i>Exploring Oral History: A Window on the Past</i> (ISBN 9781577665687); Angrosino, <i>Projects in Ethnographic Research</i> (ISBN 9781577663690); Babbie, <i>Observing Ourselves: Essays in Social Research</i> (ISBN 9781577660194); Crane-Angrosino, <i>Field Projects in Anthropology: A Student Handbook,</i> Third Edition (ISBN 9780881336856); Emerson, <i>Contemporary Field Research: Perspectives and Formulations,</i> Second Edition (ISBN 9781577661856); and Marti, <i>Starting Fieldwork: Methods and Experiences</i> (ISBN 9781478632955).</p></p><p>&#34;I was seeking a short and to-the-point book on ethnography with case studies.

For most of our history, physical activity was required for survival, but technological advances have eliminated much of the need for hard physical labor. As our activity levels have dropped, it has become clear that a physically inactive lifestyle can lead to a host of health problems. <i>Physical Activity and Health, Second Edition</i>, provides a comprehensive treatment of the research on the benefits of a physically active lifestyle in comparison with the harmful consequences of physical inactivity. </p><p> Written by leading scientists from the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia, <i>Physical Activity and Health, Second Edition</i>, brings together the results of the most important studies on the relationship between physical activity, sedentarism, and various health outcomes. The second edition has been fully updated based on the latest advances in this rapidly changing field and expanded to include the following new content: </p><p> � A chapter on the physiology of inactivity and the effects of sedentary behavior even in people who engage in appropriate amounts of physical activity, which is an area of growing interest </p><p> � More extensive coverage of physical activity, aging, and the brain, including a new chapter on the relationship between physical activity and brain structures and functions </p><p> � A chapter on the development of national and international physical activity and health guidelines, which will help readers better understand how scientific findings are converted into practical recommendations </p><p><i>Physical Activity and Health, Second Edition</i>, offers a detailed yet concise presentation of key concepts as well as a framework to help readers relate results from single studies or collections of studies to the overall paradigm linking physical activity and physical fitness to health. For each of the topics covered, the text provides an overview of the most important research findings, discusses the limitations of the current knowledge base, and identifies directions for future investigation. </p><p> At the core of the text is a review of our current understanding of how physical activity affects health concerns such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and obesity as well as aging and mental health. The text identifies sedentary living habits and poor fitness as major public health problems and examines the potential of physical activity to prevent disease and enhance quality of life. This complete resource also looks at the evolution of the field of physical activity and health; variations in physical activity levels across age, sex, and ethnic groups; the body&#x2019;s physiological responses to physical activity; dose-response issues; and the influence of genetics on physical activity, fitness, and health. The book ends with an integration of the issues covered and discusses new opportunities for research. </p><p> The second edition of <i>Physical Activity and Health</i> continues to offer clear, user-friendly coverage of the most important concepts and research in the field. Numerous special features will aid readers in their comprehension of the material. Chapter outlines and callout boxes help readers key in on important topics and focus their reading, and chapter summaries, definitions of key terms, and study questions provide tools for review and self-testing. Commonly used acronyms and abbreviations are found on the interior covers for handy reference. </p><p> Where other books have simply promoted physical activity for the individual or a population, <i>Physical Activity and Health, Second Edition</i>, completely integrates current knowledge of the relationship between physical activity and health. With contributions from some of the finest scientists in the field, this comprehensive text offers information unmatched in accuracy and reliability. </p></p><p><p><b>Claude Bouchard, PhD,</b> is the director of the Human Genomics Laboratory at Pennington Biomedical Research Center, a campus of the Louisiana State University System, where he also holds the John W.

Even more puzzling is the eighty-percent drop over nineteen years in New York City. Twice as long and twice as large, it is the largest crime decline on record. <br><br>In <em>The City That Became Safe</em>, Franklin E. Zimring seeks out the New York difference through a comprehensive investigation into the city's falling crime rates. The usual understanding is that aggressive police created a zero-tolerance law enforcement regime that drove crime rates down. Is this political sound bite true-are the official statistics generated by the police accurate? Though zero-tolerance policing and quality-of-life were never a consistent part of the NYPD's strategy, Zimring shows the numbers are correct and argues that some combination of more cops, new tactics, and new management can take some credit for the decline. That the police can make a difference at all in preventing crime overturns decades of conventional wisdom from criminologists, but Zimring also points out what most experts have missed: the New York experience challenges the basic assumptions driving American crime- and drug-control policies. <br><br>New York has shown that crime rates can be greatly reduced without increasing prison populations. New York teaches that targeted harm reduction strategies can drastically cut down on drug related violence even if illegal drug use remains high. And New York has proven that epidemic levels of violent crime are not hard-wired into the populations or cultures of urban America. This careful and penetrating analysis of how the nation's largest city became safe rewrites the playbook on crime and its control for all big cities.<br></p><p><br><strong>Franklin E.

Since 2005, he has been the first Wolfen Distinguished Scholar at Boalt Hall School of Law.

Johnson) .<br><br>"Provocative and hopeful." --<em>New York Review of Books</em> <br><p></p><br>"Accessible to both undergraduates and postgraduates, this is an excellent statistical study. The reader should not expect the master code that unlocks all of the secrets of New York's crime decline; however, <em>The City that Became Safe</em> should be considered a standard work on this fascinating phenomenon." --<em>New York Journal of Books</em> <br><p></p><br>"One of the best studies of the psychology of crime, and of cities, that I have ever read." <br>--Adam Gopnik, newyorker.com <br><p></p><br>"The City That Became Safe" is thoughtful, provocative, and quite brilliant. Zimring demonstrates that big cities can cut crime and reduce incarceration at the same time. New Yorkers, and all city dwellers, will feel safer after reading this powerful book." --Herbert Sturz, Open Society Foundations <br><p></p><br>"Franklin Zimring's examination of the astonishing New York City crime decline is fascinating and totally convincing. Reading this brilliant book is mandatory for criminologists and students of policing, and it's a damn good idea for everyone else." --Albert Alschuler, Northwestern University Law School <br><p></p><br>"Franklin Zimring boldly takes on one of the most important yet ill-understood social facts of the late twentieth century: why crime dropped like a stone for almost twenty years in New York. He hones in on the significant portion of crime that is 'situational and contingent' rather than rooted in urban structure, and identifies police policies and practices that go a long way toward explaining crime rates fell so precipitously. At the beginning of the 1990s New York was in trouble; now it is back, in large degree because of the story told here." --Wesley Skogan, Northwestern University <br><p></p><br>"A doubly profound book-in its withering demonstration that the New York City crime drop undoes much of the conventional social science wisdom about the embeddedness of American criminality, and in its optimistic lesson about the power of social policy to alter the supposedly endemic nature of urban crime." --Robert Weisberg, Stanford University <br><p></p><br>"<em>The City That Became Safe</em> sets the standard for reasoned analysis of one of the most important public-policy issues of our time." --Richard Rosenfeld, University of Missouri-St. Louis <br><p></p><br>"This is a wonderful, startling, and important book. It is a masterpiece of statistical rigor; but also of insight and common sense. All serious scholars of modern urban life, and, hopefully, all policy makers and criminologists, should read and absorb the lessons of this profound exploration of the riddles of crime and punishment in America." --Lawrence M. Friedman, Stanford University <br><p></p><br>"Using an array of statistics and a meticulous approach, Zimring, one of the nation's preeminent criminologists, convincingly argues that an identifiable human strategy does deserve most of the credit, but it was neither a single approach nor a single elected official. This is a model policy study on a crucial community concern demonstrating that, when it comes to public safety, government can make a difference. Highly recommended." <br>--<em>CHOICE</em> <br><p></p><br>"Zimring does a wonderful job letting the statistics tell the story of New York City's drop in crime... The result is a study that adds much to our knowledge of crime and crime policy while reminding us just how much we still have to learn. Recommended for all practicing criminologists and graduate students studying in the field." --<em>International Social Science Review</em> <br><p></p><br>"This book advances the discussion of urban crime policy by an order of magnitude for academics...

In return for helping him one day, a satyr grants the king his dearest wish -- all that he touches will turn to gold. For a time, the king enjoys his gift. But then the food he puts to his mouth turns to gold so he cannot eat. And the horse he mounts turns to gold so he cannot ride. And everyone he touches turns to gold so he no longer has any family or friends. He has all the gold he could ever want, but he's not at all happy. <br> How King Midas learns his lesson and finds happiness is the heart of this classic Greek myth, brought to new life by award-winning artist Demi's own golden touch. Sparkling with the colors of the Aegean Sea and with the splendor of gold, this elegant and humorous retelling of an ancient myth will be cherished by readers of all ages.</p><p>"Blessed" by the god Dionysus with the ability to turn everything he touches to gold, greedy and ignorant King Midas quickly learns that one must be careful what one wishes for. When his food and drink turn to gold, as well as his servants and every other living thing in the palace, Midas is immediately penitent. "Why did I ever ask for such a stupid gift?" he cries, as his teardrops turn to gold. <p> This classic Greek myth may be familiar to many readers, but few will deny that it has ever been presented so spectacularly. Award-winning artist Demi's paintings are shot through with gold, against Mediterranean backdrops of sea blue and purple. Each page of this gorgeous picture book is bordered with golden patterns, and a four-page fold-out depicts Midas transforming his many-columned palace into solid, immobilized gold. Here is a perfect introduction to Greek mythology for young readers who will be as mesmerized as Midas by the allure of the golden touch--Demi's in this case!

The killer is closing in on him...</p><p>I worked on this novel for about a year, certain that I knew who the killer was. However, three days before my deadline, I realized that the climax just didn't work. The only way for me to make the story satisfying and also include a twist, required me to change who the killer was.<br>Since the book is nearly 500 pages long, this meant major rewrites, which took me several months. So, if you think you know who the killer is, remember that so did I--until the story revealed that it really needed to be someone else.<br>This book includes a flashback that was so frightening some bookstores banned the book. Actually, the killer was so unsettling that I had to stop working on the novel and write a prayer book (that I had under contract with my publisher) before I was able to come back and finish the novel.<br>If you like intriguing stories with an historical connection and a chilling killer, this is probably the book for you.The stakes have never been higher. FBI Agent Patrick Bowers is used to tracking the country&#39;s most dangerous killers, but now it looks like a killer is tracking him. When he realizes the murderer is using clues from a medieval manuscript as a blueprint for his crimes, Bowers faces a race against time to decipher who the next victim will be and to stop the final shocking murder--which he&#39;s beginning to believe might be his own.

Now, at the height of his power, he heads an army of misfits, adventurers, and outcasts from across Europe and Asia, and yet wherever he goes he remains a stranger. <br><br>Ivo Andri&#x107;, who won the Nobel Prize in 1961, is a spellbinding storyteller and a magnificent stylist, and here, in his final novel, he surrounds his enigmatic central figure with many vivid and fascinating minor characters, lost souls and hopeless dreamers all, in a world that is slowly sliding towards disaster. <i>Omer Pasha Latas</i> combines the leisurely melancholy of Joseph Roth&#x2019;s <i>The Radetzky March</i> with the stark fatalism of an old ballad.</p><p><b>Ivo Andri&#x107; </b>(1892&#x2013;1975) was born to Catholic Croatian parents in a village in Austrian-occupied Bosnia. His father died when he was two, and his mother sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in Vi&#x161;egrad, a town on the Drina River near the Serbian border. In high school, he began writing poetry and joined Young Bosnia, a student revolutionary movement advocating South Slav unification. Andri&#x107; enrolled at the University of Zagreb in 1912, where he continued working with South Slav nationalist groups, then transferred to the University of Vienna, and later to the University of Krak�w, all the while publishing poems in Bosnian journals and anthologies. Upon the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914, Andri&#x107;, an associate of Gavrilo Princip, returned to Bosnia and was quickly arrested by Austrian police. Over the course of World War I, while in prison and later under house arrest, he wrote a number of prose poems that were published in two collections after the war, <i>Ex Ponto</i> (1918) and <i>Nemiri</i> (Unrest, 1920). In 1919, Andri&#x107; was appointed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the new Yugoslavian government, and served as a diplomat in the Vatican, Bucharest, Trieste, Paris, Madrid, and, finally, as the ambassador to Germany, a post he held at the outbreak of World War II. Refusing the German government&#x2019;s offer of safe passage to Switzerland, he returned to Belgrade, where he spent the war under house arrest, writing his two best-known novels, <i>Na Drini &#x107;uprija</i> (<i>The Bridge on the Drina</i>) and <i>Travni&#x10d;ka hronika</i> (<i>Bosnian Chronicle</i>), which were published in 1945. <i>The Bridge on the Drina</i> would go on to become required reading in Yugoslavian high schools, and Andri&#x107; would become a celebrity in Communist Yugoslavia. He was named the president of the Yugoslavian Writer&#x2019;s Union and in 1950 was appointed a deputy in the National Assembly of Yugoslavia. In 1958, he married Milica Babi&#x107;, a costume designer twenty years his junior, and in 1961 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. Babi&#x107; died in 1968, and Andri&#x107; lived alone in an apartment in Belgrade until his death in 1975. His funeral was attended by ten thousand people, and his former apartment was converted into a museum. <br><b><br></b> <b>Celia Hawkesworth</b> has translated nearly forty books from the Serbo-Croatian, including <i>Bosnian Chronicle</i> by Ivo Andri&#x107;; <i>The Museum of Unconditional Surrender</i> by Dubravka Ugre&#x161;i&#x107;; <i>Belladonna </i>by Da&#x161;a Drndi&#x107;, which was short-listed for the Oxford Weidenfeld prize in 2018; and <i>Adios, Cowboy</i> by Olja Savi&#x10d;evi&#x107;. <br><b><br></b> <b>William T.

Instead of Ir�ne, Jean Cocteau accompanied him. In a vain attempt to set himself at the head of the avant-garde, this ambitious young poet had inveigled Picasso into collaborating with him on </i>Parade:<i> a gimmicky, quasi-modernist ballet about the efforts of a couple of shills to lure the public into their vaudeville theater by tantalizing them with samples of their acts. Cocteau had desperately wanted Diaghilev to stage this ballet in Paris. The meddlesome Polish hostess Misia Sert had tried to scupper the project. However, Picasso's Chilean protector and patron, Eugenia Err�zuriz, had persuaded Diaghilev to agree, provided Picasso did the d�cor, Erik Satie the score, and L�onide Massine the choreography. Sets, costumes, and rehearsals were to be done in Rome, where Diaghilev had his wartime headquarters. Picasso's cubist followers were horrified that their avant-garde hero should desert them for anything as frivolous and modish as the Ballets Russes, but he ignored their complaints. After two and a half years of war, with its appalling death toll, its hardships and shortages, and above all the absence of his closest friends</i>&#x2014;<i>particularly Braque and Apollinaire at the front</i>&#x2014;<i>Picasso was elated at the prospect of leaving the bombardments and blackouts behind to spend a couple of months in the relative peace of Rome, which he had always wanted to visit. Besides working on Parade, he was determined to get married.</i>Picasso and Cocteau arrived in Rome on February 19, 1917, a day later than they had intended. Cocteau, who had forgotten to get a visa from the Italian embassy, had lied when telling him that no reservations were available. Diaghilev had booked them into the Grand Hotel de Russie on the corner of the Via del Babuino and the Piazza del Popolo. So that Picasso could work in peace on the costumes and sets for <i>Parade</i>, he had also arranged for him to have one of the coveted Patrizi studios, tucked away in a sprawling, unkempt garden off the Via Margutta. Although most of the artists are now gone, the Patrizi studios are still as idyllic as they were in 1917."I cannot forget Picasso's studio in Rome," Cocteau later wrote. "A small chest contained the maquette for <i>Parade</i>, with its houses, trees and shack. It was there that Picasso did his designs for the Chinese Conjurer, the Managers, the American Girl, the Horse, which Anna de Noailles would compare to a laughing tree, and the Acrobats in blue tights, which would remind Marcel Proust of The <i>Dioscuri</i>."[1] From his window Picasso had a magnificent view of the sixteenth-century Villa Medici, seat of the French Academy, towering above the studio garden. As he well knew, the Academy had associations with some of his favorite artists. Vel�zquez had painted the garden; Ingres had spent four years there as a fellow at the outset of his career and, later, six years as director; Corot had also worked there and caught the golden light of Rome and the <i>campagna</i>, as no other painter had done."Rome seems made by [Corot]," Cocteau reported to his mother. "Picasso talks of nothing else but this master, who touches us much more than Italians hell bent on the grandiose!"[2] That Picasso infinitely preferred the informality of Corot's radiant views to the pomp and ceremony and baroque theatricality of so much Roman painting is confirmed by his sun-filled pointillistic watercolors of the Villa Medici's ochre fa�ade&#x2014;as original as anything he did in Rome.[3]Diaghilev insisted that Picasso and Cocteau share his passion for the city. Sightseeing was compulsory that very first evening. Since there was no blackout as there was in Paris, they were able to see the Colosseum all lit up&#x2014;"that enormous reservoir of the centuries," Cocteau said, "which one would like to see come alive, crowded with people and wild beasts and peanut vendors."[4] The following morning, Diaghilev picked them up in his car for another grand tour. In the evening he took them to the circus. "Sad but beautiful arena," Cocteau wrote his mother. "Misia Sert (or rather her double) performed on the tight rope. Diaghilev slept until woken with a start by an elephant putting its feet on his knees."[5]When he arrived in Rome, Picasso was still suffering from <i>chagrin d'amour</i>. Eager to find a replacement for Ir�ne Lagut, he had promptly fallen in love with one of Diaghilev's Russian dancers, the twenty-five-year-old Olga Khokhlova. Although he courted her assiduously and did a drawing of her, which he signed with his name in Cyrillic, Olga proved adamantly chaste. Chastity was a challenge that Picasso had seldom had to face. Both Diaghilev and Bakst warned him that a respectable Russian woman would not sacrifice her virginity unless assured of marriage. <i>"Une russe on l'�pouse,"</i> Diaghilev said. Olga personified this view. She was indeed respectable: the daughter of Stepan Vasilievich Khokhlov, who was not a general, as she claimed, but a colonel in the Corps of Engineers in charge of the railway system.[6] Olga had three brothers and a younger sister. They lived in St. Petersburg in a state-owned apartment on the Moika Canal. Around 1910, the colonel had been sent to the Kars region to oversee railroad construction, and the family had followed him there. Olga stayed behind. Egged on by a school friend's sister, Mathilda Konetskaya, who had joined the Diaghilev ballet after graduating from the Imperial Ballet School, she decided to become a dancer.Olga had considerable talent. Despite starting late and studying briefly at a St. Petersburg ballet school,[7] she managed to get auditioned by Diaghilev. The Ballets Russes was having difficulty prying dancers loose from the state-run theaters and was desperate for recruits. A committee consisting of Nijinsky and the greatest of classical ballet masters, Enrico Cecchetti, as well as Diaghilev&#x2014;a trio described by another dancer as more terrifying than any first- night audience&#x2014;put Olga through her paces and accepted her. Intelligence and diligence compensated for lack of experience. Nijinsky was sufficiently impressed to pick her out of the corps de ballet.L�onide Massine, who had taken Nijinsky's place in Diaghilev's company as well as in his heart, had chosen Olga to play the role of Dorotea in <i>Les Femmes de bonne humeur</i>, an adaptation of a comedy by the eighteenth-century playwright Goldoni, with sets by L�on Bakst and a heavily arranged score after Scarlatti. It was at a rehearsal for this ballet, which would have its premiere in Rome the following month, that Picasso spotted Olga and immediately set about courting her. To familiarize himself with the techniques of theatrical d�cor as well as watch his new love at work, he helped Carlo Socrate (the scene painter who would work on <i>Parade</i>) execute Bakst's scenery. So that he could join Olga backstage, Picasso even helped the stagehands at the ballet's premiere.[8] Eighteen months later he would marry her.Compared to her predecessors&#x2014;Bohemian models Picasso had lived with in Montmartre or Montparnasse&#x2014;Olga was very much a lady, not, however, the noblewoman biographers have assumed her to be.[9] She came from much the same professional class as Picasso's family. Don Jos�, Picasso's father, may have been a very unsuccessful painter, but his brothers included a diplomat, a revered prelate, and a successful doctor, who had married the daughter of a Malague�o marquis. One of Picasso's mother's first cousins was a general&#x2014;more celebrated than Olga's parent, also the real thing. Indeed, it may have been Olga's lack of blue blood that made her so anxious to become a grande dame and bring up her son like a little prince. Arthur Rubinstein, the pianist, who had met Olga in 1916 when the ballet visited San Sebasti�n, remembered her as "a stupid Russian who liked to brag about her father, who she pretended was a colonel in the Tsar's own regiment. The other dancers assured me that he was only a sergeant."[10] This was an exaggeration, but Olga's pretensions were resented by other members of the company.Ten years younger than Picasso, Olga had fine regular features, dark reddish hair, green eyes, a small, lithe, dancer's body, and a look of wistful, Slavic melancholy that accorded with the romanticism of classic Russian ballet. Formal photographs reveal Olga to have been a beauty&#x2014;usually an unsmiling one&#x2014;although in early snapshots of her with Picasso and Cocteau in Rome, she is actually grinning. Later, she plays up to him, dances for him, takes on different personalities, which might explain the widely varying reactions to her. The celebrated ballerina Alexandra Danilova declared that Olga "was <i>nothing</i>&#x2014;nice but nothing. We couldn't discover what Picasso saw in her."[11] A Soviet ballet historian, the late Genya Smakov, found references to her in an unpublished memoir by someone working for Diaghilev, where she is said to have been "neurotic."[12] On the other hand, Lydia Lopokova&#x2014;the most intelligent of Diaghilev's ballerinas&#x2014;was Olga's best friend in the company.Picasso fell for Olga's vulnerability. He sensed the victim within. She would have appealed to his possessiveness and protectiveness especially when the Russian Revolution cut her off from her family. Her vulnerability would likewise have appealed to Picasso's sadistic side. (The women in his life were expected to read the Marquis de Sade.) In the past year rejection by the two women he had hoped to marry had left him exceedingly vulnerable. Picasso's residual bourgeois streak should also be taken into account. He was thirty-five and wanted to settle down with a presentable wife and have a son. None of his father's three brothers had had any issue, and there was pressure from his mother to produce an heir.Sexual abstinence was something Picasso had seldom if ever had to face. His two previous mistresses may have shied away from marrying him, but they had been easy enough to seduce. Olga was as unbeddable as the "nice" Malague�a girls that his family had tried to foist on him. "Don't forget Olga who cares for you very much," she wrote on the back of a dramatic photograph of herself in <i>Firebird</i>. "Who neglects me, loses me."[13] (Cocteau could not resist using the phrase <i>qui me n�glige me perd</i> as a caption to a caricature of Bakst he subsequently sent to Olga.)[14] Picasso must have been very much in love to put up with this ukase. Ernest Ansermet, Diaghilev's principal conductor, describes walking back to the Hotel Minerva, where he and the dancers were staying. Olga had the room next to Ansermet's. "I heard Picasso in the passage knocking at her door and Olga on the other side of it saying 'No, no, Monsieur Picasso, I'm not going to let you in.' "[15] Clearly, marriage was his only option.Diaghilev, who felt responsible for the genteel Russian girls in his company, advised Picasso against marrying Olga. Foreseeing problems with her parents, who were averse to their daughter marrying a mere painter, the impresario told Picasso that he had a much more suitable girl set aside for him. She was currently dancing in South America and would soon be returning to Europe. Picasso would not listen; he was obsessed by Olga. Not that this kept him away from the local brothels, to judge by an address noted down in his Roman sketchbook.[16] "In Rome of an evening," Picasso told Apollinaire, "whores ply their trade in automobiles&#x2014;at walking pace&#x2014;they accost their clients with smiles and gestures and stop the car to negotiate the price."[17] From Naples he would send Apollinaire a postcard: "In Naples all the women are beautiful. Everything is easy here,"[18] and, sure enough, the sketchbook he took with him records the address of a Neapolitan brothel. For an Andalusian, regular visits to a whorehouse would have been an obligatory response to a fianc�e's virtuous stand. Another option was an affair with a less virtuous member of the company. Picasso did that too.[19]Cut off by the war from Russia, Diaghilev and his company led a nomadic life. Their principal wartime base was Rome. Officially the impresario stayed in the Grand Hotel, but he spent most of his time in an apartment in the Marchese Theodoli's palazzo on the Corso that he had rented for L�onide Massine, the handsome twenty-one-year-old dancer, who had been his lover for the previous three years. So as not to compromise himself publicly, Massine had insisted that he and his employer live under separate roofs. That this hot-blooded heterosexual, who was also a cold-blooded operator, should have allowed himself to be captured and caged by the notoriously jealous and possessive Diaghilev is not surprising. In Russia it had been a standard career move for a dancer of either sex to have a rich, influential protector. To negotiate these arrangements, one of the company's dancers, Alexandrov, acted as pimp. Massine's predecessor in Diaghilev's life, the legendary Nijinsky, who was likewise heterosexual, had started off&#x2014;with his mother's blessing&#x2014;as the prot�g� of the rich, young Prince Lvov. The Prince had then handed him on to the Polish Count Tishkievitch, who gave him a piano.[20] Like Diaghilev's previous lover, Dimitri Filosofov, Nijinsky would leave the impresario for a woman; as would Massine.Exceedingly parsimonious and very ambitious, Massine had everything to gain from this arrangement. Diaghilev had already turned him into a star dancer, a choreographer of near genius and a major collector of modern paintings, including many Picassos and Braques. Sex with Diaghilev was part of the job&#x2014;"like going to bed with a nice fat old lady,"[21] as he told one of his mistresses, when she asked how he could possibly have done it with Diaghilev.That Massine was a passionate Hispanophile would prove to be a great bond with Picasso. The previous summer in Madrid, the dancer had agreed to choreograph two ballets with Spanish themes, <i>Las Meninas</i>, which would be put on later in 1917, and <i>Tricorne</i>, which would not appear until 1919. A small, driven, Spanish-looking Russian with enormous eyes&#x2014;in some respects a younger version of Picasso&#x2014;Massine expected the artist to teach him about modern art. He proved so perceptive and imaginative and such a quick learner that over the next ten years he and Picasso would collaborate on four great ballets.Another bond between Picasso and Massine was a passion for women&#x2014;a passion that differentiated them from Diaghilev's largely homosexual entourage. Cocteau's presence in Rome made for more pique and intrigue than usual. In the face of Diaghilev's jealousy, Picasso was delighted to provide his fellow womanizer with an alibi for his amorous escapades. After failing to persuade Picasso to spy for him, Diaghilev hired a couple of detectives to take on this job.[22] At the slightest suspicion of infidelity on Massine's part, Diaghilev would have a temper tantrum, attack the furniture with his stick, tear the telephone out of the wall and smash it.<b>NOTES</b>[1] Jean Cocteau, <i>Oeuvres compl�tes</i>, vol.

It is a book for anyone who can still look at the world with both common sense and a sense of wonder.</p><p><b>Lyall Watson</b>&nbsp;was a noted naturalist and the author of over 20 books, including <i>Supernature</i>,&nbsp;<i>Beyond Supernature,</i> and&nbsp;<i>Jacobson's Organ and the Remarkable Nature of Smell</i>. Born in Johannesburg, he earned degrees in botany and zoology from Witwatersrand University, and a doctorate in ethology from the University of London. He died in 2008.INTRODUCTION<br> &nbsp;<br> As a biologist, I am fascinated by the soft edges of science, by the fleeting glimpses we get of strange shadows just beneath the surface of current understanding.<br> &nbsp;<br> I tried in Supernature to redefine this fringe, to reconcile nature with what seems to be supernatural. And helped, up to a point, to create a sort of demilitarised zone into which both scientists and enthusiasts could go without abandoning either their sense of proportion or their sense of wonder.<br> &nbsp;<br> But that was fifteen years ago and much has happened since. The publication of Supernature made me a focus for anomalous experience &#x2013; and gave me the freedom to explore it at will. I have tried, along the way, to keep contact with those who share my excitement by putting out position papers in the form of six further books &#x2013; each looking at the loose ends of the world in a slightly different way.<br> &nbsp;<br> The time has come now, however, to go back to the beginning once again and see where we stand, almost a generation on.<br> &nbsp;<br> During the last few years there has been a strong reaction against research into the unusual. Critics of anything paranormal have established influential committees with the express purpose of stopping such research altogether. They have succeeded, in at least one case, in destroying reputations by sending magicians, posing as psychics, to ingratiate themselves with a group of researchers, with the express intent of deceiving them at every opportunity. These tactics prove nothing, except perhaps a degree of intolerance which is blatantly unscientific. There are few fields which would be proof against such invasions.<br> &nbsp;<br> Given wide public interest in the supernatural, it was probably inevitable that it should become a big business and suffer from all the distortions of the marketplace. I am ruefully aware of having helped to create this situation and accept my share of responsibility for fuelling enthusiasms which have, in some cases, got out of hand. Our culture, however, is prone to such excesses.<br> &nbsp;<br> There is, when you look at it closely, no such thing as the supernatural. All we have are reports of experiences which seem to be beyond natural explanation &#x2013; but we do have these in astonishing abundance. And the reports have become so frequent and so widespread that they are very difficult for anyone with real scientific curiosity to ignore.<br> &nbsp;<br> I am fascinated by the fact that people all over the world have, and not just in our cultish time, come to accept the existence of some sort of paranormal reality. They hold beliefs in the existence of things such as spirits, of miraculous happenings, reincarnation, communication with the dead and telepathy amongst the living &#x2013; and these beliefs are so persistent and so much alike that it is tempting to look for common cause.<br> &nbsp;<br> Where do such ideas come from and what is it that sustains them, even in the face of official incredulity and scorn? Is it possible, even if the supernatural does not exist, that we need somehow to invent it?<br> &nbsp;<br> I am not wedded to the proposition that the supernatural must exist. If one defines supernatural experience simply as &#x2013; the experience of something unusual, something which exceeds the limits of what is deemed possible &#x2013; then there is clearly a vast field of experience, of repeated experience, from all over the world, just waiting to be explored. The fact that such reports are, by their very nature, largely anecdotal, has led to their being discarded as unacceptable to science. Which is a pity and a waste, because I suspect that answers to some of the riddles of the paranormal might well lie in the pattern and content of such reports.<br> &nbsp;<br> The greatest barrier to scientific acceptance of anything unusual remains its elusiveness. Which is a problem that leaves parapsychology &#x2013; for the moment the most formal and least disreputable approach &#x2013; an immature science without basic principles or consistent findings, hoping still to produce the elusive repeatable experiment. Failure so far to do so in the laboratory makes it easy for some orthodox scientists to dismiss the supernatural as meaningless; but it is difficult for anyone like myself, who has been involved in the field, that is outside the confines of the lab, to deny the common and powerful reality of experience that breaks the rules.<br> &nbsp;<br> My own experience of the unusual in action in a wide variety of cultures, suggests very strongly that there is something well worth pursuing. I have watched the rise of interest in the occult &#x2013; and the inevitable backlash &#x2013; with fascination. I have shared the high expectations of those trying to get to scientific grips with telepaths and metal-benders; and suffered with them the disappointment of discovery that the phenomena are strangely, almost wilfully, elusive. I understand the disillusion which has resulted, but must say that nothing has happened in the last fifteen years to alter my certainty that we stand to learn important things about ourselves from scrutiny of those areas in our lives that can be almost commonplace, but nevertheless defy easy description.<br> &nbsp;<br> I believe that what the supernatural very badly needs is a new and fresh and thorough overview. A cross-cultural survey of the paranormal. An ethnography of the unusual. A broadly based and well-funded professional operation designed to retrieve and catalogue and classify all unusual events everywhere.<br> &nbsp;<br> This is unfortunately not it. This is nothing more than my own personal attempt to make sense of what I have seen and heard in recent years. It is an attempt to define and describe the range of unusual experience a little more precisely. An attempt which I sincerely believe to be necessary, because I remain convinced that there are things going on around us which cannot easily be squeezed into forms that fit the accepted mould.<br> &nbsp;<br> So, despite the cavils of self-appointed committees for the suppression of curiosity, I continue to pursue ghosts on the edges of perception. I persist in pointing out inconsistencies in natural history &#x2013; not because these necessarily mean anything in themselves, but because they could lead to better understanding of what is usual through a new and more open-minded analysis of the pieces that don&#x2019;t quite fit.<br> &nbsp;<br> And as with Supernature, I offer this new survey to all those who can still look at the world with wide eyes &#x2013; and wonder.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lyall Watson&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Ballydehob, Ireland; 1985<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Part One<br> &nbsp;<br> LIFE<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There is one common flow, one common breathing, All things are in sympathy.&#x201d;<br> HIPPOCRATES in De Alimento, Fifth Century BC<br> &nbsp;<br> The life sciences are in a curious state.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ever since the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953, they have been dominated by molecular biology. We have cracked the genetic code which determines the sequence of amino acids in proteins. We know most of the details involved in protein synthesis from these acids. We have started to unravel the mysteries of those special proteins known as enzymes which knit assorted biochemicals into the complex machinery of viruses and bacteria. And we begin to understand, in principle at least, the astounding regulations which govern the workings of a living cell.<br> &nbsp;<br> This prowess, rewarded and reinforced by several Nobel Prizes, has produced a kind of academic euphoria &#x2013; a feeling that, at last, we are on the brink of a full explanation of all the phenomena of life.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nothing could be further from the truth.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our ability to ask, and answer, questions about the mechanics of life has drawn attention away from our continuing inability to understand the real nature of living things. Our impressive achievement at physical and chemical levels, conceals an almost total lack of progress in coming to terms with general biology.<br> &nbsp;<br> We know a great deal about the parts of living things, but next to nothing about the process which assembles those components into a functional whole.<br> &nbsp;<br> All life possesses properties which are peculiar, which cannot be understood in terms of the properties of the isolated parts. The whole creature is always much more than the sum of its parts. It contains structures and exhibits behaviour which cannot be predicted from a study only of the known ingredients. There is something missing from the mechanistic model, something which seems to have no roots in even the most sophisticated biophysics or biochemistry.<br> &nbsp;<br> Life remains mysterious. Biology is rife with unsolved, perhaps insoluble, problems.<br> &nbsp;<br> Classical physics was revolutionised in 1927 by Werner Heisenberg&#x2019;s uncertainty principle, which made it clear that certain microphysical events could never be completely known. That, despite our best intentions &#x2013; to a very real extent, directly because of these intentions &#x2013; some things could be predicted only in terms of probabilities. Biology has yet to produce its Heisenberg, yet to come to terms with such weakening of the traditional laws of cause and effect.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this first section, I want to look at a few of the consequences of this imbalance in understanding. And show how it might begin to be restored by concentrating more on the form and shape of whole organisms than on the details of their structure.<br> &nbsp;<br> There are certainly some astonishing things going on.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Child of a Mad God: A Tale of the Coven (The Coven, 1)</h2><p><p><b>A thrilling and dark new epic fantasy adventure begins, perfect for fans of Glen Cook and Joe Abercrombie.</b></p><p>When Aoleyn loses her parents, she is left to fend for herself among a tribe of vicious barbarians.

One of America&#x2019;s most celebrated living photographers, Catherine Opie works in series that are remarkably varied in<br>both style and subject matter&#x2015;from intimate portraits of the<br>LGBTQ community to beautiful, nearly-abstract landscapes<br>featuring ice-fishing houses. Expanding that astonishing<br>range of subjects further is Opie&#x2019;s ambitious recent series of<br>photographs taken at the home of late movie star Elizabeth<br>Taylor. Though glamour and celebrity are not common<br>themes in her work, Opie was inspired by the possibilities this<br>project offered&#x2015;recalling William Eggleston&#x2019;s series on Elvis<br>Presley&#x2019;s Graceland, or her own photographs of Obama&#x2019;s<br>2008 inauguration, both of which represent indirect portraits<br>of their subjects. The images in this moving collection<br>were culled from photos Opie took over the course of six<br>months, both on the grounds of and inside Taylor&#x2019;s home.<br>The subjects are wildly diverse&#x2015;a dog-eared remote control<br>manual, close-ups of Taylor&#x2019;s enormous closets, shelves of<br>tchotchkes and priceless works of art&#x2015;telling more about<br>Taylor&#x2019;s life than any &#x201c;celebrity&#x201d; portrait ever could. Through<br>Opie&#x2019;s thoughtful curation, Taylor&#x2019;s home tells a poignant<br>story and reveals the arc of a fascinating life.</p><p>Catherine Opie is Professor of Photography at the University of California, Los Angeles. Her works have been exhibited in numerous solo shows, including a mid-career retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, 2008."Midway through the project [Elizabeth Taylor] was hospitalised, and on March 23 2011 she passed away. As an artist it was an emotional and moving time for me to bear witness to her life and to her loss. Her home underwent many changes following her death. These photographs reflect that transition in a subtle way, while still maintaining an intimate portrait of Elizabeth Taylor through her personal space."&#x2014;Catherine Opie, as quoted in the <i>Financial Times<br></i><br>"Liz Taylor never let a photographer into her home&#x2014;until Catherine Opie came along. The result is as visual paean to the life (and loss) of a legend . . . Flipping through [<i>700 Nimes Road</i>], you feel a little like a child stealing into her mother's room to run her hands over dresses and rummage through drawers. All that&#x2019;s missing is the scent of Taylor's perfume."&#x2014;<i>Town &amp; Country<br></i><br>"Not long before she passed away in 2011 at age 79, Elizabeth [Taylor] opened up her surprisingly cozy six-bedroom, six-bath LA house to photographer Catherine Opie. The spectacular results can be found in the new book and exhibition named after the actress' Bel Air address, <i>700 Nimes Road</i> . . . And while the space is every bit as stunning as the actress herself, Opie points out that it 'wasn't just pristine&#x2014;it was a well-loved and well-used home, too . . . Everything had value to her, from the Krupp Diamond ... to the stuffed animal that leaned against a little rocker.'" &#x2014;<i>Closer</i> <br><br>"Although the two never met in person, Opie&#x2019;s new book . . . assumes a powerful, shared intimacy through [her] pictures of Taylor&#x2019;s shoes, jewelry, heirlooms, and other artifacts of fame and family." &#x2014;<i>WMagazine.com<br></i><br>"She was one of the most photographed women in the world&#x2014;but these quiet pictures of her Bel Air home, which she allowed just before her death in 2011, reveal more about Elizabeth Taylor than any portrait."&#x2014;<i>People Magazine<br><br></i>&#x201c;Catherine Opie&#x2019;s photographs of Elizabeth Taylor&#x2019;s curtains, closet, and kitchen&#x2014;taken in 2010 and 2011, the year that Taylor died&#x2014;are elegiac and stately, and deeply revealing of Taylor&#x2019;s interior life.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;Alex Abramovich, <i>The New Yorker</i></p><h2>The Little Guide to Getting Tied Up: Tips for Rope Bondage Bottoms</h2><p><p>"The number-one piece of required reading for anyone who plans to have rope on their body." --Topologist, rope bondage instructor</p> <p>The pioneering book on getting tied up for fun, from bedroom play to advanced suspensions.

While he addresses the dividing lines and dangers facing our nation, the religious and cultural commentator&#x2019;s focus isn&#x2019;t politics; it&#x2019;s faith.</p><p>As he has done throughout his career, Wallis offers comfort, empathy, and a practical roadmap.&nbsp;<em>Christ in Crisis</em>&nbsp;is a constructive field guide for all those involved in resistance and renewal initiatives in faith communities in the post-2016 political context.</p></p><p><p>Jim Wallis is the author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>God's Politics</em>, which electrified Americans disenchanted with how the Right had co-opted all talk about integrating religious values into our politics by offering an alternative voice. Wallis is a leading figure at the crossroads of religion and politics in America today, the author of eight books, and the founder of Sojourners, a global faith and justice network. He is a public theologian, an internationally renowned speaker and preacher, a faith-based activist, husband, and father to two young boys, and a Little League baseball coach. </p><p>&#x201c;For far too long, we&#x2019;ve ceded the power and person of Jesus to political movements with no ambitions toward His radical love. Reclaiming Jesus is not only our responsibility, it is necessary now more than ever. Jim Wallis clearly lays out the questions we each must answer in order to tread the pathway toward His reclamation. This is a book for right now, for all God&#x2019;s people.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;<strong>Brittany Packnett,</strong> <strong>co-founder of Campaign Zero</strong><br> <br> &#x201c;Jim Wallis offers a challenging and focusing return to the deep Gospel wellspring of our faith that has served us in many troubled times and places across the centuries.

With mastery and clarity, Jim Wallis has crafted a handbook for our times&#x2014;a way to interpret Jesus&#x2019;s life and wisdom for a nation in crisis, to inspire Christians and non-Christians alike in the labor of love and justice.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;<strong>Valarie Kaur, Sikh activist and founder of the Revolutionary Love Project</strong><br> <br> &#x201c;Jim Wallis is faithful, relentless, and intrepid in voicing the prophetic reality of Gospel faith. He does not flinch at truth-telling, and he is not weary of hope-telling. Wallis of course is completely in on the deep socio-economic political realities we face. But here he cuts deeper to consider our most elemental hope as Christians and our most elemental mandate as disciples. For those with a domesticated or privatized Jesus, this book is a wake-up call. For those who mean well but tremble in timidity, this book is summons and a model for courage and boldness. For those at the edge of despair, this book is an offer of honest buoyancy that does not wax and wane with daily headlines. Wallis witnesses to the faithfulness of God bodied in Jesus as sufficient ground for our living of faithful lives that have transformative capacity. He attests the way in which Jesus shows up at the center of our best hope and our best truth. I anticipate that this book will provide energy, grit, and courage for the living of these days.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;<strong>Walter Brueggemann,</strong> <strong>author of <em>The Prophetic Imagination</em></strong><br> <br> &#x201c;America yearns for an appropriate reintroduction to the person named Jesus.&nbsp;For years, Jesus has been hidden by shallow religion and dishonest commentary.

Wallis sensitively yet forthrightly addresses the looming social and political issues of our day while reframing them not as right or left, conservative or liberal, but as right and wrong based on the life and teachings of Christ. For anyone who wants to carefully ponder how to live as a person of faith, a loving neighbor, and a concerned citizen, <em>Christ in Crisis</em>&nbsp;is an indispensable guide.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;<strong>Jemar Tisby,</strong> <strong>author of <em>The Color of Compromise</em></strong><br> <br> &#x201c;Wallis is a Bonhoeffer for our times.

His praise was echoed by other reviewers and by readers, who embraced the book as they might a displaced person in one of Malamud's stories, now returned to us, complete and fulfilled and recognized at last. The volume gathers together fifty-five stories, from "Armistice" (1940) to "Alma Redeemed" (1984), and including the immortal stories from The Magic Barrel and the vivid depictions of the unforgettable Fidelman. It is a varied and generous collection of great examples of the modern short story, which Malamud perfected, and an ideal introduction to the work of this great American writer.</p></p><p>Due to his formidable skill as a novelist--and to the fact that one of his novels, <i>The Natural</i>, had the good or bad luck to be repackaged as a large-screen vehicle for Robert Redford--Bernard Malamud hasn't always been recognized as short-story master of the first rank. As this collection demonstrates once and for all, he is. The anthology pieces, such as "The Magic Barrel," "The Silver Dish," or "Rembrandt's Hat," would be more than enough to place the author in the pantheon. But the 54 stories gathered here represent an astonishing abundance of narrative smarts and brilliant, Yiddish-accented prose. Malamud's heroes meet all manner of misfortune--there's something distinctly Job-like about even his most contented characters (a typical one has "a sort of indigenous sadness [that] hung on or around him")--yet the author suffuses their woes with gentle comedy. And while Jews occupy center stage in almost every tale, they are universal rather than parochial figures: as the beleaguered tailor in "Angel Levine" triumphantly informs his wife, "Believe me, there are Jews everywhere."<p>Acclaimed for his short stories, <b>Bernard Malamud</b> (1914-1986) received two National Book Awards (for <i>The Magic Barrel</i> and the novel <i>The Fixer</i>) and the Pulitzer Prize (for<i> The Fixer</i>). A native of Brooklyn, he taught for many years at Bennington College.</p></p><h2>The Dorothy Dunnett Companion (Volume II)</h2><p>Dorothy Dunnett has earned worldwide acclaim for the masterful blending of historical fact and imagination in her two series of novels set in brilliantly reconstructed fifteenth- and sixteenth-century landscapes.<br> <b><br> The Dorothy Dunnett Companion II</b> is an encyclopedic resource that completes and expands the reach of the first <i>Companion</i> in documenting the historical and literary riches of Dunnett's Lymond Chronicles and House of Niccolo novels. In this second guide<i>,</i> Elspeth Morrison not only covers the final three Niccolo novels for the first time, but also provides a wealth of additional information about all of the earlier novels and highlights the links between the two now-completed series. Once again, she illuminates the real figures and events and the cultural and literary allusions Dunnett weaves into her works, translating foreign phrases and offering up fascinating background details, from the history of golf and the argot of galley slaves to the uses of puffins and polar bears. Together with the first <i>Companion,</i> <b>The Dorothy Dunnett Companion II<i> </i></b>provides a complete and essential guide to the world of Lymond and Niccolo.</p><p>"[Dunnett's novels are] vivid, engaging, densely plotted . . . sustained by a riot of tangible detail that makes real the world she has conjured up. . . .

Readers will meet them all: the native peoples, early explorers and traders, Mormon pioneers, miners and ranchers, and even today&#39;s developers. In addition to detailing the state&#39;s major historical events, author Cindy Bennett displays a love of Utah that casts a warm glow on her accounts of tiny settlements taking root and growing into amiable towns like Pleasant Grove, whose main landmark today is a hamburger joint called the Purple Turtle, and Richmond, home of Utah&#39;s first evaporated-milk factory. Bennett relates stories such as the terror of Bear Lake, where for years a 75-foot monster was believed to lurk until it was discovered that the disturbance in the water were caused by local cattle. These, and many more tales, are the compelling stories of Utah&#39;s exceptional people.</p><p>Cynthia Larsen Bennett was born in Utah and spent her school years in Michigan and Washington. She earned a BA in humanities from Brigham Young University in 1981, after which she married and settled in the Salt Lake area. Since then, Bennett has "explored just about every square mile" of the state, her love of the land, history, and people of Utah growing with each trip.<br>Bennett lives in Layton with her husband and their three children. <i>Roadside History of Utah</i>, her first book, "is the result of a lifetime of stories passed down from parents and grandparents...and seventeen years of in-depth exploration in this magnificent state."&#34;This book is just the ticket for history buffs exploring the state, a real Baedeker to toss into the car. But it is also well worth the reading while only cruising about in your favorite armchair.&#34; --Signals from Telegraph Hill</p><h2>Infant Baptism and the Covenant of Grace</h2><p>Paul Jewett, author of the creative and highly provocative book, Man As Male and Female, now turns his critical attention to the practice of infant baptism. Jewett does not accept the traditional &#x201c;covenant&#x201d; argument for baptizing infants, and this book explains why he believes this argument fails. / Infant baptism is not a subject which can be isolated. For, as Jewett would have his readers understand, one's view on this issue is integrally related to one's view of the sacraments in general and thereby to the whole doctrine of the church and salvation. Thus it is understandable that what appears to be a minor theological question has had such divisive effects on the church. / A discussion of the historical source of infant baptism begins Jewett's critique, and introduces such issues as the distinction between infants and children, the silence of certain early church fathers on the subject, infant communion, and catechetical instruction. / The second and major portion of this book examines the theological issue, focusing specifically on the covenant argument, which suggests that baptism replaces circumcision as the sign of the covenant and thereby is given to infants. This argument, Jewett claims, fails to take into account the historical character of revelation, and contains certain contradictions. / Jewett concludes with a creative defense of believer baptism, one which is theologically responsible and which recognizes the profound truths of covenant theology.</p><p>Paul K. Jewett (1919&#x2013;1991) was professor of systematic theology at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California. He also wrote Man as Male and Female and God, Creation, and Revelation.</p><h2>Why I Can&#39;t Read Wallace Stegner and Other Essays: A Tribal Voice</h2><p><p>This provocative collection of essays reveals the passionate voice of a Native American feminist intellectual. Elizabeth Cook-Lynn, a poet and literary scholar, grapples with issues she encountered as a Native American in academia. She asks questions of critical importance to tribal people:&nbsp; who is telling their stories, where does cultural authority lie, and most important, how is it possible to develop an authentic tribal literary voice within the academic community?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the title essay, &#x201c;Why I Can&#x2019;t Read Wallace Stegner,&#x201d; Cook-Lynn objects to Stegner&#x2019;s portrayal of the American West in his fiction, contending that no other author has been more successful in serving the interests of the nation&#x2019;s fantasy about itself. When Stegner writes that &#x201c;Western history sort of stopped at 1890,&#x201d; and when he claims the American West as his native land, Cook-Lynn argues, he negates the whole past, present, and future of the native peoples of the continent. Her other essays include discussion of such Native American writers as Michael Dorris, Ray Young Bear, and N. Scott Momaday; the importance of a tribal voice in academia, the risks to American Indian women in current law practices, the future of Indian Nationalism, and the defense of the land.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cook-Lynn emphasizes that her essays move beyond the narrowly autobiographical, not just about gender and power, not just focused on multiculturalism and diversity, but are about intellectual and political issues that engage readers and writers in Native American studies. Studying the &#x201c;Indian,&#x201d; Cook-Lynn reminds us, is not just an academic exercise but a matter of survival for the lifeways of tribal peoples. Her goal in these essays is to open conversations that can make tribal life and academic life more responsive to one another.</p></p><p>&#34;The invasion of North America by European peoples has been portrayed in history and literature as a benign movement directed by God, a movement of moral courage and physical endurance, a victory for all humanity. This portrayal of colonialism and its impact on the unfortunate natives/Indians who possessed the continent for thousands of years before the birth of America seems to go unchallenged in either politics or letters by most mainstream thinkers. It arrives in academia unscathed, to be spoonfed to future generations.&#34;-Elizabeth Cook-LynnThis provocative collection of essays reveals the passionate voice of a Native American feminist intellectual.

The book begins with the awakening of students' interest in spirituality and the initial encounter with Tibetan Buddhism, then leads us through all the steps necessary for successful practice in the West. Included is succinct counsel on finding an appropriate teacher, receiving empowerments, becoming active in a center, and launching and sustaining a Vajrayana practice. Special emphasis is placed on the potential pitfalls, and the marvelous benefits, of the guru-disciple relationship.</p><p>As Tibetan Buddhism extends its reach in the West, many practitioners are making strong commitments to this path. The Vajrayana tradition still being new to our culture, however, there remain significant gaps in Western students' education and understanding. These can lead to practical difficulties for new or intermediate students. This book begins with the very awakening of students' interest in spirituality and their initial encounter with Tibetan Buddhism, and then leads them through the steps necessary for successful practice in the West. <p>A Beginner's Guide to Tibetan Buddhism speaks powerfully and directly to the Western student who is working to integrate this incredibly vast tradition into the realities of daily life. Drawing on his many years of practice and teaching, the author skillfully addresses obstacles, doubts and confusions that every reader will recognize. </p><p>"Bruce Newman has been my close student for almost thirty years.

This incorporeal being offers a feeling of hope, protection, and guidance, and leaves the person convinced he or she is not alone. There is a name for this phenomenon: it&#x2019;s called the Third Man Factor.<p>If only a handful of people had ever encountered the Third Man, it might be dismissed as an unusual delusion shared by a few overstressed minds. But over the years, the experience has occurred again and again, to 9/11 survivors, mountaineers, divers, polar explorers, prisoners of war, sailors, shipwreck survivors, aviators, and astronauts. All have escaped traumatic events only to tell strikingly similar stories of having sensed the close presence of a helper or guardian. The force has been explained as everything from hallucination to divine intervention. Recent neurological research suggests something else.</p><p>Bestselling and award-winning author John Geiger has completed six years of physiological, psychological, and historical research on the Third Man. He blends his analysis with compelling human stories such as that of Ron DiFrancesco, the last survivor to escape the World Trade Center on 9/11; Ernest Shackleton, the legendary explorer whose account of the Third Man inspired T. S. Eliot to write of it in <i>The Waste Land</i>; Jerry Linenger, a NASA astronaut who experienced the Third Man while aboard the <i>Mir</i> space station�and many more.</p><p>Fascinating for any reader, <i>The Third Man Factor</i> at last explains this secret to survival, a Third Man who�in the words of famed climber Reinhold Messner��leads you out of the impossible.&#x201d;</p></p><p><b>John Geiger</b> is the award-winning author of four non-fiction books, including the international bestseller <i>Frozen in Time: The Fate of the Franklin Expedition</i>. He is editorial board editor at <i>The Globe and Mail</i>. He is a fellow of the Explorer&#x2019;s Club, New York, and governor of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society and chair of the Society&#x2019;s Expeditions Committee. His work has been translated into nine languages. He lives in Toronto.A scientific mystery or divine intervention is how Geiger, the editorial board editor at the <i>Globe and Mail</i> and author of <i>Frozen in Time</i>, describes The Third Man Factor, the human knack of facing deprivation and possible death with an unseen presence pointing the path to survival. He researched these visitations for six years, chronicling their history in harrowing life-and-death events with mountaineers, sailors, divers, aviators and polar explorers. It is to Geiger's credit that he stresses the very human need to endure and survive through critical times in the included anecdotes over the sometimes convoluted scientific jargon, especially the gripping tales of the last 9/11 survivor Ron DiFrancesco, NASA astronaut Jerry Linenger aboard the Mir space station and merchant seaman Kenneth Cooke, who paddled in shark-infested waters. Whether this guardian angel factor is neurological or divine, Geiger's fresh, insightful book will tell readers things that are not easily explainable, but no less real for that. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The subtle musings of Toni Cade Bambara, Henry Dumas, and Harryette Mullen are bracketed by the profane and often loud ruminations of Langston Hughes, Darius James, Wanda Coleman, Tish Benson, Steve Cannon, and Hattie Gossett. Some of the funniest writers don't write, so included are selections from well-known yet unpublished wits Lightnin' Hopkins, Mike Tyson, and the Reverend Al Sharpton. Selections also come from public figures and authors whose humor, although incisive and profound, is often overlooked: Malcolm X, Suzan-Lori Parks, Zora Neale Hurston, Sojourner Truth, and W.E.B. Dubois. Groundbreaking, fierce, and hilarious, this is a necessary anthology for any fan or student of American writing, with a huge range and a smart, political grasp of the uses of humor.</p></p><p><b>Paul Beatty </b>is author of four novels, <i>Slumberland, Tuff, </i><i>The White Boy Shuffle</i>,<i> </i>and <i>The Sellout</i>, which won the 2016 Man Booker Prize<i>. </i>He has also written two books of poetry: <i>Big Bank Take Little Bank</i> and <i>Joker, Joker, Deuce.</i> He lives in New York City.Acclaimed novelist Beatty (<i>Tuff</i>; <i>White Boy Shuffle</i>) models this controversial anthology on a "mix-tape narrative dubbed by a trusted... friend." Like a mix-tape, the collection is intensely personal: its encompassing feature is the bright, plaintive, scathingly ironic voice that introduces the volume and its various sections. Beatty, who "was the butt of the first joke [he'd] ever heard," mines two centuries of African-American culture for speeches, poems, fiction, comics and screenplays that mirror his own glass-cutting wit and satisfy, in places, his taste for "unintentional comedy." (To wit, "The Wit and Wisdom of Mike Tyson.") Apart from usual suspects like Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston, a Norton anthology this is not. Selections from Fran Ross and Prophet Omega dizzy readers in their logical funhouses. Hattie Gossett's "80s Version of the Dozens" leads them through sewer pipes of lyrical imagination. The volume's general tenor is wild, winking and explosive. As such, it picks up where <i>Chappelle's Show</i> left off&#x2014;gouging the government, lampooning cultures black and white, leaving no sacred cow unslaughtered. Even the smiling watermelon on the book's front cover has been retained despite sniffs by national media outlets. "This is black humor," Beatty writes, "and I don't mean African-American black." Indeed, at times&#x2014;as when John Farris's schoolchildren blithely gun down pedestrians&#x2014;you may need night-vision goggles to find the joke. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A detective yarn and a picaresque tale.&#x201d; (Richard Bernstein, <i>The New York Times</i>)</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Shortly before noon on October 28, 1728, General Yue Zhongqi, the most powerful military and civilian official in northwest China, was en route to his headquarters. Suddenly, out of the crowd, a stranger ran toward Yue and passed him an envelope&#x2014;an envelope containing details of a treasonous plot to overthrow the Manchu government.&nbsp;<br><br>This thrilling story of a conspiracy against the Qing dynasty in 1728 is a captivating tale of intrigue and a fascinating exploration of what it means to rule and be ruled. Once again, Jonathan Spence&nbsp;has created a vivid portrait of the rich culture that surrounds a most dramatic moment in Chinese history.</p><p>Jonathan Spence's eleven books on Chinese history include <i>The Gate of Heavenly Peace</i>, <i>Treason by the Book</i>, and <i>The Death of Woman Wang</i>. His awards include a Guggenheim and a MacArthur Fellowship. He teaches at Yale University.The General <p>General Yue Zhongqi has risen far and fast, which is what makes the present moment so dangerous for him. Born in 1686, the son of a general, Yue was a major at age twenty-five, a colonel at thirty-two, and was named commander-in-chief of Sichuan province at thirty-five. His string of military successes includes campaigns along the Tibetan border, in Kokonor, against mountain tribes in Xining, in China's westernmost province of Gansu, and on the borders of the far southern province of Yunnan. Now, in late October 1728, at the age of forty-two, not only is he governor-general of two provinces, and the regional commander-in-chief, but he has also been ennobled by a grateful emperor, and his own son in turn has been swiftly promoted to high office and is currently the acting governor of one of the strategic coastal provinces. The Yue family are rich; they hold huge estates in Gansu province in the far west, and in Sichuan to the south. The family inventories list dozens of properties held in the Yue name, great mansions with tiled roofs and multiple courtyards in several major cities, fine farmland scattered across several regions, and scores of caretakers and bailiffs who manage the estates when Yue Zhongqi is away on duty. </p><p>Yet despite his power and wealth, Yue Zhongqi knows he is totally at the emperor's mercy. Everything he has earned and won could vanish in an instant should the emperor doubt his loyalty. For the current emperors of China are the Manchus, warrior stock from the north, who conquered the armies of the floundering Ming dynasty in 1644 with their cavalry, established the Qing dynasty in its place, and have ruled the country ever since, constantly watchful to preserve their own prerogatives. </p><p>Another factor underlines the precariousness of General Yue's position: the burden of his family name. Yue Zhongqi is both blessed and cursed by being a distant descendant of another General Yue-Yue Fei-who six centuries earlier, in the time of the Song dynasty, tried to rally the Chinese of his own day to reclaim the lands they had lost in the north to barbarian conquerors. Yue Fei fought as long and as bravely as he could, until betrayed by his own countrymen and jealous courtiers. Imprisoned on a trumped-up charge, Yue Fei died in captivity, and the northern lands were lost. With time, Yue Fei's recklessness came to be seen as statesmanship, and his yearning plea to regain for China her "mountains and rivers" became a rallying cry for all Chinese people. Shrines to Yue Fei were erected in his native place. Plays and novels celebrated his passionate ambitions. Storytellers elaborated on his punctilious character and his prowess on the battlefield. They made their listeners weep as they recorded the warrior's courage amidst the carnage of war, and the perfidy of the political enemies who betrayed him. The Manchus who overthrew the Ming in 1644 were descendants of those same Jurchen tribesmen against whom Yue Fei fought for so long; thus, not surprisingly, Yue Fei's memory became once more a rallying cry for those who hated the Manchus. However loyal Yue Zhongqi may be to the current Manchu emperor, the popular belief is that he is primed for vengeance by virtue of his ancestral blood, and poised to restore China's former glories. General Yue knows this, and he knows that his emperor knows it. </p><p>Alone in his study, Yue Zhongqi moves to the heart of the letter that has just been handed to him. Some of it he has heard before and knows all too well, such as the passage hailing him as "the descendant of the Song dynasty martial prince Yue Fei," and urging him to "seize the chance to rise in revolt, and avenge the fates of the Song and Ming." "Once you have taken someone as your true ruler," the letter continues, "you should guard your relationship to that former person to the death. But instead you bow your head and compromise your loyalty by serving a bandit ruler." By serving the Manchus instead of keeping the faith with his illustrious ancestor, the current general Yue has compromised his very being: "A minister's choosing his ruler is like a woman following her husband. A man serving someone who is not truly his ruler, and thereby losing his moral character, is like a woman who has once been married and gets married for a second time." </p><p>But the letter by this man who calls himself Summer Calm also takes the familiar litany out into new terrain: "When the rulers of the Ming dynasty lost their virtuous ways, the land of China was submerged, the barbarians took advantage of our weakness to enter, and usurped our precious throne," he writes. "The barbarians are a different species from us, like animals; it is the Chinese who should stay in this land, and the barbarians who should be driven out." The reasons for this are obvious: "Heaven gives birth to humans and to things. The principle is one, though the manifestations are many. Those living on Chinese soil have the proper elements, their yin and their yang are in harmony, they possess virtue, they are human. Those outside the borders, in all four directions, they are oblique and vicious by nature, they are the barbarians. Below the barbarians come the animals." </p><p>Other passages in the letter speak of the portents darkening China's future as the country suffers under the barbarian Manchus' rule: "Heaven and earth are overturned, darkness prevails, there is no light." That is why, the letter continues, the Temple of Confucius recently burned down. That is why, for the last five or six years, floods and droughts in uneasy sequence have ravaged much of China, so that crops have been lost, the balance between hot and cold seasons has been destroyed, "mountains collapsed, rivers dried up." That is why "the five stars converged," "the Yellow River flowed clear," "yin was exhausted and yang began to rise." </p><p>In some passages, the letter's author reflects on the imbalances of a social order in which "the land has all been taken over by the rich-the rich get richer every day, and the poor get poorer." Summer Calm clearly separates himself from these wealthy families: "Living in the present day, and making my way in the present world, I have no intention of seeking profit or rank-these would defile me." Perhaps he is a farmer? "I live in seclusion on an empty mountain, with one or two like-minded friends, raising our chickens and growing melons." Yet if he is a farmer, he cares for old texts, old days, and has a sense of history. For the writer of this letter, nothing good in a scholarly or political sense has happened in China during the five centuries that have passed since the fall of that Song dynasty which Yue Fei fought so hard to preserve. In all that time, up to the present, only one scholar has "upheld the ideal," and that was the man whom the letter writer calls "The Master of the Eastern Sea." </p><p>As to the reigning emperor, Yongzheng, Summer Calm expresses nothing but disgust, and for General Yue's benefit he marshals the negative arguments: the emperor under whose rule they both are living has murdered several of his brothers, both older and younger; he has plotted against his parents; he persecutes his loyal ministers, and gives his ear only to sycophants; he is greedy for material gain, despite the richness with which he lives; he is ever eager to kill others, often drinks himself into oblivion, and cannot control his sexual passions. Could anyone be surprised that "the sky is shaking, the earth is angry; demons cry, gods howl"? </p><p>It is early afternoon by the time Yue Zhongqi finishes the letter. It has not been hard to read the letter in privacy, but many people have seen the letter delivered into his hands, and he must proceed with care. He will need unimpeachable witnesses if he is to question the messenger. If he were to investigate such an incredible document on his own, or to question the messenger in secret, even if he were to get the truth would anyone believe him? </p><p>The last time Yue Zhongqi found himself in a somewhat similar predicament was around fifteen months before, in early August 1727, when he was serving as the commanding general in the city of Chengdu, down in the southwest in Sichuan province. Just after noon, on August 4, a man was seen running wildly through the streets. He carried a stone in each hand, and shouted out for all to hear that a great upheaval was coming, that "Old Yue" would rise up with his cavalry and troops in Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces to overthrow the government. Within the very walls of Chengdu itself, secretly organized gangs would arise at the same time from their hidden bases near the city gates and would begin a bout of random killings. </p><p>That the city watchmen who first reported the incident and Yue's senior colleagues who investigated it all thought the man was mad was little solace to Yue Zhongqi himself. He still had to report the whole humiliating incident to the emperor, for he knew that his colleagues-even those among them he considered his friends-would be reporting it as well. Trivial though the incident might seem, both their careers and his depended on never concealing a single act that might be seen to threaten the regime. As Yue rather bitterly noted in his report to the emperor at that time, "If people are truly mad, there is nothing they cannot say, and no person they cannot destroy." And in a follow-up report Yue poured out his sense of anguish and guilt, lambasting himself for his failures as a general and as an official, confessing to financial and administrative errors and to mistakes in judgment, repeatedly referring to his own weakening health, and finally requesting to be relieved of all his duties. </p><p>Responding to Yue's reports in an edict issued later that same summer of 1727, Emperor Yongzheng handled the whole matter of the Chengdu incident with candor. Over the years, wrote the emperor, he had received numerous warnings of Yue Zhongqi's potential for disloyalty, warnings that were often linked to rumors that the general might seek to relive the triumphs of his ancestor Yue Fei. As emperor, he chose to ignore them all, and indeed had promoted Yue to ever-higher positions out of absolute confidence that the charges were groundless. His only regret was that these scurrilous accusations demeaned not only General Yue himself but also the loyal people of Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces, who formed the backbone of Yue's armies. </p><p>In a separate set of confidential comments for the general's eyes only, written in vermilion ink between the columns of Yue's impassioned outpourings, the emperor reassured Yue that he considered the charges Yue was directing against himself to be basically trivial matters, unworthy of further consideration. No one had mentioned them to the emperor before, and he did not care to know about them now. Yue should stay at his post, and get on with the work he had been appointed to do. Yue's poor health, however, was a real concern. Accordingly the emperor would send his own most trusted court doctor, Liu Yuduo, down to Chengdu, with a range of the medicines for which he was justly famous, to give Yue a thorough examination. Dr. Liu did indeed arrive in Chengdu, and spent three days checking the general's pulse rhythms, and in experimenting with different dosages of medication, before hitting on a formula that suited the general perfectly, brought an end to his nagging anxieties, and rebuilt his bodily strength. </p><p>Since the Chengdu case might leave rumors hovering in the air, rumors that could damage Yue's reputation and encourage doubts in the public's mind about the tranquillity of the region, Emperor Yongzheng also appointed a special investigator from the Ministry of Punishments to travel down to Chengdu and check things out for himself. Arriving in mid-September 1727, the investigator personally questioned the alleged madman, along with his relatives, anyone who had shared lodgings with him, and the members of the patrol that arrested him. The rigorous questioning-some of it under torture-revealed no instigators behind the scenes, and no traces of a concealed plot. It was clear that the madman, Lu, had acted alone while in a delirium caused by a protracted bout of malaria that had lasted over a month, leaving him weakened and desiccated. Lu had no memory at all of his actions in the street on that early August day. If there was any calculation behind his words and actions, it was that he had been driven to a state approaching madness even earlier, during a protracted struggle with the authorities to regain some land he had sold, under duress, to a brutal neighbor. The refusal of the various officials in the countryside where he lived to reopen his case had led Lu at last to Chengdu, in the hopes of catching the attention of the recently appointed general, Yue, who had a reputation for fairness. The investigator in 1727 also clarified some puzzling details in the case: for instance, Lu had been carrying a stone in each hand to drive away the wild dogs that followed him through the streets; the wildness of his gaze sprang from the delirium that fixed his eyes in an unyielding stare; once placed in a cart by the watchmen, to be conveyed to the city jail, all his energy evaporated, and he fell at once into a deep and trancelike sleep. </p><p>Yue Zhongqi was lucky that time, and apparently the case left no lingering resentments. But how can Yue report yet another case, of an oddly similar kind, not much more than a year after that earlier one, and still retain his emperor's confidence? His main hope for imperial understanding must be to keep the record limpidly clear, to have no suggestion of any hidden double-dealing. Only testimony from the most impeccable corroborating sources can be used. Lowly witnesses obviously will not do-for this is treason of the gravest kind. Twice Yue Zhongqi sends members of his personal staff to the second-ranking official in Shaanxi province, Governor Xilin, who also resides in Xi'an, asking him to report at once to the general's office. But the governor replies that he cannot come-he is out at the military training grounds in the northeastern part of the city, checking the martial skills of those taking the current round of military examinations. It would not be tactful in the circumstances for General Yue to order Governor Xilin to come, since the governor is a career Manchu bureaucrat, only one grade junior to General Yue, and the training ground is in the very middle of the "Manchu city" of Xi'an. That Manchu enclave was formed from the entire eastern half of the city after it was seized from the Chinese residents in 1646, fortified with its own inner walls, and made the permanent and protected residence area for five thousand Manchu garrison troops along with their more than fifteen thousand dependents. </p><p>Dipping, of necessity, one rung down in the bureaucratic hierarchy, Yue Zhongqi calls instead on the third-ranking official stationed in Xi'an, Judicial Commissioner Shise. This man's office is just across the road from the governor-general's compound, beside that same Drum Tower where the messenger had been waiting, and as it happens Shise is free, and is able to respond to Yue's call. After the two officials have consulted together briefly, Yue installs the commissioner in a room adjacent to the main office, so that he can hear everything that transpires ...</p></p><h2>A Train of Powder</h2><p>Like most all of Rebecca West's reportage, <i>A Train of Powder</i> approaches great literature. Written between 1946 and 1954, these accounts of four controversial trials explore the nature of crime and punishment, innocence and guilt, retribution and forgiveness. The centerpiece of the book is "Greenhouse with Cyclamens," a three-part essay on the Nuremberg trials written with precision, clarity, and daring insight. She also reports on two particularly brutal murder trials &#x2015; one for a lynching in North Carolina, the other for a "torso murder" in England &#x2015; and the espionage trial of a British telegrapher. Throughout, the question of guilt inspires Ms. West to feats of psychological detection wherein unerring craftsmanship and a powerful narrative sense combine to a high purpose &#x2015; the pursuit of truth. "An astonishing book.... As compelling as Court TV but without the frisson of voyeurism (and with the compensatory satisfactions of West's breathtakingly lucid prose style), these elegant narratives remind us of the preciousness and fragility of our right to trial by jury."&#x2015;Francine Prose. "It is her unique magic to combine impressionism and precision, as if Monet and Ingres could somehow be fused. Time and again a passage begins as a sort of iridescent cloud, and culminates in a diamond point."&#x2015;Telford Taylor, <i>Saturday Review</i>. "Rebecca West...has raised journalism to a high art, breathing into it a depth, a poetry, a subtlety, and an understanding and compassion for human beings and their endless follies and tragedies that give it a legitimate place in contemporary literature."&#x2015;William L. Shirer.</p><p>Rebecca West was one of the foremost journalists of our time, best known for her books <i>Black Lamb and Grey Falcon</i> (about Yugoslavia between the wars) and <i>The Meaning of Treason</i>.An astonishing book...Elegant narratives with lucid prose.

Inspector Darko Dawson has seen many crimes, but this latest string of murders&#x2014;in which all the young victims bear a chilling signature&#x2014;is the most unsettling of his career. Are these heinous acts a form of ritual killing or the work of a lone, cold-blooded monster? With time running out, Dawson embarks on a harrowing journey through the city&#x2019;s underbelly and confronts the brutal world of the urban poor, where street children are forced to fight for their very survival&#x2014;and a cunning killer seems just out of reach.</p><p><b>Kwei Quartey </b>was raised in Ghana by an African American mother and a Ghanaian father, both of whom were university lecturers. Dr. Quartey practices medicine in Southern California, rising early in the morning to write before going to work.PART ONE<br> <br> 1<br> <br> The call had come in on a Sunday morning in June.<br> <br> "For this one," Detective Sergeant Chikata hadsaid, "I think they will need us."<br> <br> On his Honda motorbike, Detective Inspector Darko Dawsonsped by industrial buildings along Ring Road West. The dead body was near theKorle Lagoon. He made it there in fifteen minutes. Even if Dawson's eyes hadbeen shut, the pervasive, foul smell of the lagoon would have announced to himthat he had arrived.<br> <br> He turned onto Abossey Okai Road, which formed twobridges, the first of them over the refuse-choked Odaw River, which flowed intothe lagoon. Agbogbloshie Market on Dawson's left and Kokomba Market on hisright teemed with Sunday shoppers and hawkers trying to sell everything frombananas to sea crabs.<br> <br> At the second bridge, over a much smaller channel oftarry, polluted water, there were umbrella-shaded market vendors, pedestrians,trucks, and cars mixed together in organized chaos. Dawson parked and lockedhis bike. Sprawling onto the riverbanks, a crowd of onlookers overflowed bothends of the bridge. Standing at over six feet, Dawson could see above mostpeople's heads. Detective Sergeant Chikata and a uniformed man Dawson didn'tknow were about a hundred meters up on the south bank of the channel. Framedapocalyptically against dense black smoke billowing from somewhere upstream,Deputy Superintendent Bright and three members of his crime scene team, all inmasks, gloves, and galoshes, were moving about knee-deep in the foul mire.<br> <br> Dawson skirted the mass of the crowd and made his wayonto the bank. It was carpeted with litter, much of it plastic bottlesdiscarded without a second's thought after the contained water had been drunk.The rest of the junk included boxes, tin cans, abandoned clothing, trash bags,pieces of machinery, old tires, coconut husks, and unidentifiable bits of metaland plastic detritus. There was also the kind of human waste Dawson definitelydid not want his shoes to touch, some of it exposed, some of it in "flyingtoilets"-tossed black plastic bags with excrement inside.<br> <br> The impossibly good-looking Detective Sergeant Chikata,Dawson's junior in rank in the Criminal Investigations Department (CID)Homicide Division, looked up as Dawson approached.<br> <br> "Morning, Dawson."<br> <br> "Morning, Chikata."<br> <br> "Body of a dead male spotted in there thismorning."<br> <br> "How did we get notified?"<br> <br> Chikata introduced the bulky, flinty-eyed man next tohim. "This is Inspector Agyekum. He was the Korle Bu station officer thismorning."<br> <br> Agyekum was Detective Inspector Dawson's rank equivalent,but as a general inspector he wore the standard, heavy, sweltering dark blueuniform of the Ghana Police Service (GPS) in contrast to CID's plainclothesmen.<br> <br> "Morning, Inspector." Dawson shook hands,finishing with the customary mutual finger snap.<br> <br> "I was starting my shift when a small boy came intothe station," Agyekum took up. "That's him there with ConstableGyamfi." He pointed his chin farther along the bank where a policeconstable stood over a boy of about eight sitting on the ground with his headdown and his arms folded tightly across his skinny body.<br> <br> "Many people saw the body," Agyekum continued,"but because they fear the police, they just kept quiet. But the boy tookit upon himself to run over to the Korle Bu station to report it."<br> <br> "He's a brave young man," Dawson said, lookingover at the boy with approval. "And then?"<br> <br> "Constable Gyamfi took the report in the station andbrought it to me," Agyekum said, "then the two of us returned withthe boy. When I saw the body there, I decided to call the Crime SceneUnit."<br> <br> "Very good," Dawson said. "Thankyou."<br> <br> Dawson knew Police Constable Gyamfi from a previous casea year ago. He waved at the constable, who smiled and half waved, half salutedin return.<br> <br> "Mr. Bright says he's quite sure it's ahomicide," Chikata said.<br> <br> "Then it probably is," Dawson said.<br> <br> Deputy Superintendent Bright, a trained serologist, washead of the CSU team. His hunches were seldom wrong.<br> <br> Dawson moved a little closer to the water, which was thecolor of tar and almost the same consistency. He winced at its relentlessstench, but people living within smelling distance were used to it, or maybejust ignored it.<br> <br> Bright and his two crime scene guys squelched around ?looking for an unlikely clue. There was so much garbage it would be a miracleif they found anything useful. Only Bright's relentless thoroughness andcommitment to excellence had deemed the search necessary. Others might havesimply reeled the corpse in without bothering.<br> <br> The garbage partially camouflaged the dead body, whichwas facedown. On casual glance, it could have been mistaken for a big clump ofrubbish, and undoubtedly had been.<br> <br> With glop sucking at his galoshes, Deputy SuperintendentBright joined Dawson and the other two men.<br> <br> "Morning, Dawson." His voice sounded like thebass notes of a bassoon. "Please excuse my appearance and odor."<br> <br> "Good morning, sir. I admire you for going inthere."<br> <br> Bright looked down at his soiled outfit with a grimace."These are the last of our hazardous materials garb, so fortunately ornot, I won't be doing this again for a while."<br> <br> "Any findings, sir?" Dawson asked.<br> <br> "Besides the body? Nothing. Still suspect foul play,however. I know a dumped corpse when I see one. And this one is in terribleshape."<br> <br> "When are you bringing it in?"<br> <br> "We're almost ready for that now."<br> <br> "Can you wait a few minutes? I don't want the boy tosee that."<br> <br> "No problem, Dawson."<br> <br> "Thank you, sir. It's good to have you around."Dawson turned and trotted up the bank.<br> 2<br> <br> The boy was still with Police Constable Gyamfi, who wasin his mid-twenties but looked so young he could have gone undercover as a highschool student. As Dawson approached, Gyamfi's face lit up with a smile ofstrong, white teeth-the kind that could snap the top off a beer bottle.<br> <br> "Morning, Gyamfi," Dawson said as they claspedhands. "How are you? It's nice to see you again."<br> <br> "Yes, sir, and you too."<br> <br> "How're the wife and new daughter?"<br> <br> "Very well, sir, thank you, sir."<br> <br> "Good, I'm glad."<br> <br> Gyamfi was a recent import from the rural town of Ketanuin the Volta Region. With Dawson's help and persistence, he had beentransferred to the police force in Accra, not an easy achievement in the GPS.He was a good man with great integrity and promise.<br> <br> Dawson looked down at the boy, who didn't return thelook. He wore torn cutoff jeans, a soiled black-and-white muscle shirt that wastoo big for him, and slippers that were falling apart on his dusty feet. He wasstaring at a point on the ground in front of him. Dawson knelt down.<br> <br> "How are you? I'm Darko. What's your name?"<br> <br> The boy's eyes flitted up and away. "Sly."<br> <br> Dawson held out his hand. Sly shook it after a second'sconsideration.<br> <br> "Thank you for what you did," Dawson said."You were brave to go to the police station. Do you know that?"<br> <br> Sly nodded tautly. Dawson lifted his face with a touch tohis chin.<br> <br> "Are you all right?"<br> <br> "Yes."<br> <br> "I'm not going to do anything to you. I only want tobe your friend."<br> <br> Sly nodded again. Dawson stood and reached for the boy'shand, pulling him up. "Let's go for a walk."<br> <br> "Okay."<br> <br> "While we're gone," Dawson said to Gyamfi,"I want you to talk to these people in the crowd. We need to know ifanyone saw anything this morning or last night in connection with the body. Weneed names, and we need a way to get back in touch with them. That might behard around here, but do your best."<br> <br> "Yes, sir."<br> <br> "And always remember faces, Gyamfi. Try to make yourmind a camera. You never know who you might run into later on."<br> <br> Dawson turned away with Sly and steered him around thepack of spectators. As he and the boy walked past, every head turned to watchthem. Dawson took a quick but good look at all the faces, practicing what hehad just preached to his constable. In reality, the chance was remote that theywould get usable information from anyone. Watching policemen at work was okay,talking to them was not.<br> <br> Dawson and Sly were now walking along the curve of theOdaw River's east bank toward the shacks of the slum in the distance.<br> <br> "How old are you, Sly?"<br> <br> "Nine."<br> <br> "From northern Ghana?"<br> <br> "Upper West Region."<br> <br> Dawson had made an educated guess. Most of Agbogbloshie'sresidents came from northern Ghana.<br> <br> "Where do you live?"<br> <br> "Here in Sodom and Gomorrah."<br> <br> It was the bitter, ironic nickname for Agbogbloshie,Accra's most notorious slum. Drugs, prostitution, rape, forty thousandsquatters, and practically every year a new but unsuccessful government plan torelocate them.<br> <br> Dawson and Sly walked the beaten path through mounds oftrash containing the ubiquitous plastic bags and bottles, carcasses of old TVs,trashed scanners, mobile phones, air conditioners, refrigerators, fax machines,microwaves, dead computer monitors and defunct CPUs. To their left was amountain of electronic waste piled higher than Dawson's head.<br> <br> "What were you doing this morning when you saw thatdead man in the water?" he asked Sly.<br> <br> "Burning cables."<br> <br> That was what caused the dense black smoke all along thebanks of the Odaw. The boys burned TV and computer cables to get at the copperwires, which they sold locally for fifty pesewas per kilo, or about eighteencents per pound.<br> <br> Ahead was a line of teenage boys that made Dawson thinkof an assembly line, only this was disassembly. The first boy was breaking openthe back of an old TV monitor using a rock. The second was degreasing somecables with a solvent. Farther along still, a cable-burning session wasbeginning. Five boys of ages ten to fifteen were crowded around a mass ofprepped cables. All from northern Ghana, they addressed Sly in rapid-fireHausa. Although Dawson wasn't fluent in the language, it was obvious they wereasking who he was. Sly's response seemed to satisfy them because they noddedand smiled.<br> <br> "I tell them you're my friend," Sly explained.<br> <br> "Where did you learn English?" Dawson asked.<br> <br> "I was schooling at my hometown before my fathertold me to come to Accra with my uncle."<br> <br> "Are you continuing school here?"<br> <br> "No."<br> <br> "Why not?"<br> <br> "My uncle says he won't send me to school. He justwants me to sell copper and make money."<br> <br> Dawson said nothing to that, for now anyway.<br> <br> The Hausa boys used insulation foam as kindling and acigarette lighter to start the burn. Poking the cables with sticks brought theneeded rush of oxygen and created a miniature inferno with a blast of deadlyblack smoke. Even though he was upwind from it, Dawson caught a good whiff andbacked away slightly, thinking of the toxicity of the fumes. With his foot, heflipped over a piece of plastic from a computer monitor and found a label thatread school district of philadelphia. Junked, unusable equipment that the richcountries passed off as charitable donations ended up right here inAgbogbloshie.<br> <br> "Ask them if any of them saw the dead person backthere or heard anything about it," Dawson said to Sly.<br> <br> The boy obliged. His friends, intent on their task,replied briefly.<br> <br> "They didn't see anything," Sly said."They haven't heard anything."<br> <br> Dawson nodded. He hadn't expected much more than that.Fact was, if the dead person wasn't a friend of theirs or otherwise important,it just wasn't of that much interest to them. Someone died. So what?<br> <br> "Let's go," Dawson said to Sly. A littlefarther along he put his hand on the boy's head like he was palming a soccerball. "Burning that stuff is dangerous. There's poison in the smoke andyou're breathing it inside your body. You understand?"<br> <br> Sly nodded, but uncertainly. Dawson wasn't sure he reallydid get it. He ruffled his companion's short, wiry hair. "You're a goodboy, Sly. Is your uncle at home?"<br> <br> Sly was hesitant about something.<br> <br> "You don't like your uncle?" Darko asked.<br> <br> "Yes, I like him," Sly said.<br> <br> But the changed tone of his voice, broken up like ableat, told Dawson he wasn't telling the truth.<br> <br> "Don't be afraid," Dawson said. "I onlywant to talk to him."<br> <br> Roaming the open land bordered by the Ring Road on thewest and the edge of the Odaw River on the east were a few grazing horses and aherd of placid, foraging cows, brought all the way from the northernterritories by migrants who had lived as nomads. It was a bizarre mixing ofrural lifestyle with the urban slum. Only in Accra, Dawson thought. Only inAccra.<br> <br> Deep within Agbogbloshie, Sly walked with easy assurance,as if floating over the rocky ground. He skipped nonchalantly across guttersfilled to overflowing with garbage encased in opaque, grayish black glop. Heducked under laundry hung out to dry on clotheslines crisscrossing like railwaytracks. He took narrow, abruptly swerving passages between rows of ricketyhomes constructed of wood that just begged for a conflagration.<br> <br> Life went on here with the same inevitability it doesanywhere else. People worked and traded, children played, women got their nailsdone, men had their hair cut, and a group of shirtless teenage boys watchedsoccer on a communal TV.<br> <br> Here and there, Dawson caught a whiff of marijuana, or"wee," as it was popularly known. From his nasal passages, it wentlike a blast to a pleasure spot inside his brain. He felt that tug of desirethat told him he had not yet conquered his vice. Five months completely clean.One day at a time.<br> <br> People asked Sly who his companion was. He gave the sameanswer every time. "He's Darko, my friend." It was best that way.They didn't take to policemen. If casual queries about the corpse in the lagoonyielded little to no useful information, it was still more than Dawson wouldget if people knew he was a detective.<br> <br> They passed a small mosque that stood out as one of thefew brick buildings in Agbogbloshie. A man inside was prostrate on his prayermat.<br> <br> "There is my house," Sly said, slowing down andpointing. "Where those boys are playing."<br> <br> Four teenagers were kicking and heading a soccer ballback and forth to one another without allowing it to touch the ground. A mansat in front of a windowless, eight-foot-square wooden shack raised off theground on short stilts.<br> <br> "Is that your uncle?" Dawson asked.<br> <br> "Yes."<br> <br> Sly's uncle saw them approaching. For a moment he didn'tmove, but he finally rose to his feet as they came closer. He was frowning-thepuzzled kind of frown-and then he looked wary.<br> <br> "Good morning?" He was average height withsquinting eyes. His hair was graying at the temples and retreating from hisdome forehead. He had tribal marks on both cheeks.<br> <br> "Good morning, sir. My name is Darko Dawson."<br> <br> "Yessah. I'm Gamel." His voice was like gravel.<br> <br> Behind him, the door of his living quarters was ajar, andDawson caught a glimpse of a thin foam floor mattress as holey as Swiss cheese.</p><h2>Two Wheels North: Bicycling the West Coast in 1909</h2><p>The bold adventures of two young men who pedaled, pushed, and walked their bikes a thousand miles north for fifty-four days, from Santa Rosa, California, to the great 1909 Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition in Seattle. Readers of all ages will find themselves pulled into the resolute push to complete the trek.</p><p>Evelyn McDaniel Gibb is an award-winnning writer whose stories and articles have appeared in dozens of magazines and in the popular &#34;Chicken Soup for the Soul&#34; series of books. She lives in Kent, WA.Gibb, winner of the Pacific Northwest Writers Association Nonfiction Book Award, retells this wonderful rite of passage culled from interviews with her father about his bicycle trip from Santa Rosa, California, to Seattle, Washington, with his best chum, Ray, in 1909. Peddling north to the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition with only a few dollars, these two encounter one adventure after another. In 54 days, they ride and walk more than 1,000 miles and mail accounts of their trip back to their sponsor, the <i>Santa Rosa Press Democrat</i>. With excerpts of these accounts heading each chapter, one has to wonder if the readers back in 1909 were gypped of this more detailed, revealing record. Adventures, written in the dialect of the times, highlight every other page--a snake attack, crossing dangerous train trestles, fending off thieves. Of course, no story would be complete without meeting the pretty girl and falling in love or interesting characters and generous folks willing to offer a place to sleep and a home-cooked meal. This book will surely appeal to all ages and is a true delight. <i>Brenda Barrera</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

A masterpiece and a bestseller in France, it is now a major motion picture directed by Julian Schnabel. On 8 December 1995, Jean-Dominique Bauby suffered a massive stroke and slipped into a coma. When he regained consciousness three weeks later, the only muscle left functioning was in his left eyelid although his mind remained as active and alert as it had ever been. He spent most of 1996 writing this book, letter by letter, blinking as an alphabet was repeatedly read out to him. &#39;The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly&#39; was published in France on Thursday 6th March 1997. It was immediately hailed as a masterpiece. And then, three days later, he died. &#39;The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly&#39;, which records Bauby&#39;s lonely existence, is probably the most remarkable book about the triumph of the human spirit, the ability to invent a life for oneself in the most appalling of circumstances, that you will ever read. It has now been made into a captivating film, directed by Julian Schnabel and starring Mathieu Amalric, which was the winner of the award for Best Director at Cannes and nominated for the Palm d&#39;Or.</p><p>We've all got our idiosyncrasies when it comes to writing--a special chair we have to sit in, a certain kind of yellow paper we absolutely must use. To create this tremendously affecting memoir, Jean-Dominique Bauby used the only tool available to him--his left eye--with which he blinked out its short chapters, letter by letter. Two years ago, Bauby, then the 43-year-old editor-in-chief of <i>Elle</i> France, suffered a rare stroke to the brain stem; only his left eye and brain escaped damage. Rather than accept his "locked in" situation as a kind of death, Bauby ignited a fire of the imagination under himself and lived his last days--he died two days after the French publication of this slim volume--spiritually unfettered. In these pages Bauby journeys to exotic places he has and has not been, serving himself delectable gourmet meals along the way (surprise: everything's ripe and nothing burns). In the simplest of terms he describes how it feels to see reflected in a window "the head of a man who seemed to have emerged from a vat of formaldehyde.""Was it Hemingway who defined grace under pressure? No matter who said it, the words have never been more pertinent than in speaking of this heroic book, dictated against the worst imaginable adversities. Although every word cost the author a superhuman effort, the prose is not sickbed telegraphese but rather as light as the sprightliest humor, as pungent as the taste of cooking apricots, as vigorous as the step of a young man setting out on a first date. Read this book and fall back in love with life."<br>-- <b>Edmund White</b><p>"To read this most extraordinary of narratives is to discover the luminosity within a courageous man's mind. Locked into his own world but not locked out of ours, [<b>]Jean-Dominique Bauby[</b>] explores images, memories and an entire landscape of fantasy and love. His incomparable final gift to us is a heartbreaking and yet glorious testament to the wrenching beauty of the human spirit."<br>-- <b>Sherwin B. Nuland, M.D.</b></p><p>"As riveting as a narrative from an explorer of deep space, this communication from a mind imprisoned in an unresponsive body is remarkable for its utter lack of self-pity or sentimentality. Though 'locked in' the author's consciousness freely roams through worlds of memory, fantasy, sense, impression, and contemplation of the human condition.

She always dreams big.The Art of Sinning <br> <br>One<br> <br>London, England<br> <br>Late August 1829<br> <br>London&#x2019;s loftiest lords and ladies packed the ballroom in the duke&#x2019;s mansion for the wedding breakfast of Dominick Manton and his new bride, Jane. But despite the number of pretty women among them, Jeremy Keane, American artist and rumored rakehell, wanted only to flee. <br> <br>He shouldn&#x2019;t have attended. He should have stayed upstairs in his guest bedchamber doing preliminary sketches for his painting, even though inspiration eluded him and he still hadn&#x2019;t found the right model. Anything would be better than enduring this paean to domestic bliss. <br> <br>Thunderation. He hadn&#x2019;t expected it to unsettle him so. Seeing a bride and groom smile adoringly at each other shouldn&#x2019;t continue to bring back the past, to plague him with the guilt of knowing&#x2014;<br> <br>Muttering a curse, he snatched a glass off a tray held by a passing footman and downed champagne, wishing for something stronger. He couldn&#x2019;t take much more of this.<br> <br>With purposeful steps, he headed across the ballroom toward the entrance. He had to escape before he said or did something he regretted.<br> <br>Then the woman of his imagination entered, and he stopped breathing. She was magnificent. She wore a dress of emerald silk that shimmered in a shaft of sunlight as if the heavens had opened to show her to him. <br> <br>He couldn&#x2019;t believe it. She was exactly the model he required for his latest work. <br> <br>As he watched, the brunette glanced about her. Tall and luxuriously figured, she towered over the delicate Englishwomen simpering their way through the crowd. With her strong features, jewel-green eyes, and generous mouth, she was the very image of the Juno in Gavin Hamilton&#x2019;s Juno and Jupiter. She even carried herself like that majestic Roman goddess. <br> <br>She was absolutely perfect. It was not only in her looks, but her stance, at once self-effacing and imbued with drama. It was in the wariness lurking in her eyes.<br> <br>He must have her. After months of looking for the right model, he deserved to have her. <br> <br>That was, assuming she would agree to his proposition. She looked old enough to be her own woman, but he couldn&#x2019;t tell from the cut of her ball gown if she was unattached, widowed, or married. He hoped it was one of the latter two. Because if she were a rank innocent, he&#x2019;d have a devil of a time convincing her family to allow her to sit for him. <br> <br>He started toward her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jeremy!&#x201d; cried a female voice behind him. &#x201c;There you are!&#x201d;<br> <br>He turned to find Zoe, his distant cousin as well as the pregnant sister-in-law of the groom, waddling toward him. Damn. He was trapped. Worse yet, when he glanced back for his goddess in green, she&#x2019;d vanished. Of all the blasted bad luck. In a mansion like the Duke of Lyons&#x2019;s, there was no telling where she&#x2019;d gone.<br> <br>Stifling a curse, he faced Zoe. &#x201c;Good evening, coz. Nice to see you again.&#x201d;<br> <br>After bussing him on each cheek, she pulled back to glare at him. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t laid eyes on you in three months and that&#x2019;s the insipid welcome you give me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m still tired from the trip,&#x201d; he lied. &#x201c;I just arrived from Calais yesterday evening, you know.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry you and your apprentice had to stay with Max and Lisette last night, instead of at our house. But what with the wedding&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You had too many other guests to juggle. I know. And there was more room here, anyway.&#x201d;<br> <br>That seemed to relieve her. &#x201c;Thank you for understanding. But everyone is leaving this afternoon, so I do hope you&#x2019;re coming back to the town house with us as planned.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If I can hold out until you&#x2019;re ready to leave,&#x201d; he said dryly.<br> <br>She flashed him a veiled glance. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure wedding celebrations aren&#x2019;t your favorite.&#x201d;<br> <br>His heart dropped into his stomach. Was she referring to Hannah? He hadn&#x2019;t thought any of Zoe&#x2019;s family knew about that part of his life. &#x201c;What makes you say that?&#x201d; he asked hoarsely.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I assume any bachelor would find weddings dull, but especially you.&#x201d; She laughed gaily.<br> <br>No. She didn&#x2019;t know about Hannah. <br> <br>Relief flooding him, he forced a sardonic smile. &#x201c;Weddings are more exhausting than dull. Between fleecing all the lords in the card room and comforting all the disappointed young lovelies who missed out on snagging the groom, I&#x2019;m fairly worn out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Comforting? Is that what they&#x2019;re calling it now?&#x201d; She shook her head. &#x201c;I see that your travels haven&#x2019;t changed you one whit. You&#x2019;re as incorrigible as ever.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know me.&#x201d; He somehow managed a light tone. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the fun in being corrigible?&#x201d;<br> <br>Thank God she hadn&#x2019;t guessed at the truth: that he hated weddings because they reminded him of his own over a decade ago. Which had been followed six months later by a funeral with two coffins&#x2014;one for his wife and one for his stillborn son.<br> <br>Regret and anger roiled in his gut. Damn it, he&#x2019;d suppressed the image of those coffins for a while now. Must it rise again every time he attended some fool&#x2019;s wedding?<br> <br>Fortunately, Zoe didn&#x2019;t seem to notice his consternation. &#x201c;Anyway,&#x201d; she said breezily, &#x201c;I thought I should tell you that your sister and your mother are on their way to London.&#x201d;<br> <br>God help him. That was the last thing he needed. &#x201c;I suppose they think to fetch me back home to Montague.&#x201d;<br> <br>Situated on the banks of the Brandywine River a few hours from Philadelphia, his family homestead held the largest of the textile mills that were the source of his family&#x2019;s fortune. And now that his late, unlamented father was dead, his sister Amanda was running them all, since she possessed a half interest in the properties. He held the other half, although he&#x2019;d toss it into the sea before he&#x2019;d set foot on Montague land again. <br> <br>The better choice, of course, was to sell Amanda his half. She wanted it, and he wanted to give it to her. But since the properties had all come from his mother&#x2019;s family, Father&#x2019;s will demanded that Mother agree to the sale. And so far she had refused, confound her.<br> <br>She ought to know better than to think he would return to run the mills. He loved his mother and sister dearly, but Father&#x2019;s death hadn&#x2019;t changed a damned thing about his feelings for Montague. He would rather cut his own throat than carry on Father&#x2019;s legacy. And the sooner Mother realized it, the better off everyone would be.<br> <br>&#x201c;When do they leave for England?&#x201d; Jeremy asked. How much time did he have to prepare?<br> <br>&#x201c;When did they leave for England, you mean. They should arrive within a few weeks.&#x201d; She ducked her gaze. &#x201c;No doubt they departed as soon as they got my letter.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your letter?&#x201d;<br> <br>Zoe stuck out her chin, though she still wouldn&#x2019;t meet his eyes. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t blame me for taking pity on them. You don&#x2019;t keep them informed about where you&#x2019;re headed.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because it&#x2019;s none of their concern!&#x201d; When she flinched, he moderated his tone. &#x201c;And because I rarely know where I&#x2019;m going next. I could write and say, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m sailing the Danube with an Austrian prince and his consort,&#x2019; but by the time they receive the letter, I&#x2019;m likely to have befriended some monk with an Alpine refuge full of sculptures that I&#x2019;m off to view.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Precisely,&#x201d; she said hotly. &#x201c;As you&#x2019;re so fond of saying, you blow with the wind. That makes it hard for them to keep up with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t need to.&#x201d; He crossed his arms over his chest. &#x201c;The point of this trip across the Atlantic was that I got to travel the British Isles and the Continent to see works of art I&#x2019;d never experienced.&#x201d; And to make a life for himself well away from home. &#x201c;They know that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, but Amanda is desperate to speak to you about your father&#x2019;s estate. So when she wrote asking after you, I told her that you were returning to London to view the British Institution&#x2019;s annual summer exhibition before it closes at the end of the month. I thought your family might get the letter in time to be here for that, but I gather that the crossings have been rough recently, so my letter and their ship were probably delayed.&#x201d;<br> <br>Scrubbing a hand over his face, Jeremy muttered a series of oaths under his breath. &#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t have interfered.&#x201d;<br> <br>Zoe laid her hand on his arm. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the closest thing I have to a brother. I hate to see you at odds with your family.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not at odds with anyone. But there&#x2019;s no point in talking to them. They have their minds made up about&#x2014;&#x201d; Catching himself before he could reveal too much, he pasted a bland smile to his lips. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter. What&#x2019;s done is done. I&#x2019;ll deal with them.&#x201d; Somehow. <br> <br>She cocked her head. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t run off again, will you? You&#x2019;ll wait for them to arrive?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I came for the exhibition, remember?&#x201d; he said irritably. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t yet had a chance to view it.&#x201d; <br> <br>He thrust aside the possibility that his sister might have an urgent reason for needing him. If it had been so blamed important, she could have included that information in a letter to Zoe. And clearly she hadn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>Zoe arched an eyebrow. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t put it past you to flee as soon as my back is turned. You have a bad habit of avoiding your American family.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was more a case of avoiding what they wanted of him, though he couldn&#x2019;t say that. Instead, he donned the role that had become natural around Zoe. &#x201c;You know me,&#x201d; he said genially. &#x201c;Never met a responsibility I couldn&#x2019;t shirk.&#x201d;<br> <br>She looked as if she were about to speak, when someone hailed her from across the room. &#x201c;Oh, dear, I&#x2019;m being summoned. I believe we&#x2019;re starting the wedding toasts.&#x201d; She hurried off as fast as she could with a babe in her belly.<br> <br>Wonderful. Now he had to endure a series of sentimental pronouncements about the marital future of the happy couple. <br> <br>His gut knotted, and he frowned. He refused to sit through that. And it wasn&#x2019;t as if he could wander the crowd, looking for his Juno during the toasts, anyway. That would draw too much attention.<br> <br>So he&#x2019;d just escape until the wedding party was done with their maudlin speeches. Thank God he&#x2019;d thought to tuck his cigar case into his pocket. Pausing only to snag a lit taper, he fled through some French doors onto the empty terrace. <br> <br>But not empty for long. Hot on his heels came another man, apparently thinking to escape the toasts as well. Jeremy didn&#x2019;t mind. He hated smoking alone.<br> <br>The fellow stopped short at the sight of Jeremy and glanced back into the crowded room. Then, with a look of grim purpose, he shut the door behind him and evidently resigned himself to having company. <br> <br>Jeremy took pity on the chap. &#x201c;Cigar?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;God, yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lighting both off the taper, Jeremy offered one to his new companion. He watched as the dark-haired man in perfectly tailored attire puffed on it with what looked like satisfaction.<br> <br>&#x201c;These are good,&#x201d; the man said, as if surprised.<br> <br>&#x201c;They ought to be. Brought them from America myself.&#x201d; Jeremy drew on his.<br> <br>The fellow shot him a hard glance. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re American?&#x201d; <br> <br>He nodded. &#x201c;The name is Keane. I&#x2019;m a distant cousin of the groom&#x2019;s sister-in-law.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the artist whom the papers criticize so much.&#x201d; <br> <br>Jeremy grimaced. &#x201c;Indeed I am.&#x201d; <br> <br>The man gazed back into the room. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Blakeborough. A . . . er . . . friend of the bride&#x2019;s family. Of sorts.&#x201d;<br> <br>The bitterness in the man&#x2019;s tone gave Jeremy pause. He&#x2019;d heard that name somewhere. Ah, yes. Lord Blakeborough. Or more precisely, Edwin Barlow, the Earl of Blakeborough. &#x201c;Rumor has it that you were jilted by the bride,&#x201d; Jeremy said with a bluntness equal to the earl&#x2019;s.<br> <br>Blakeborough scowled at him. &#x201c;Rumor has it that you&#x2019;re an arse.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Rumor is correct.&#x201d; Jeremy took a puff of his cigar. Might as well live down to his reputation.<br> <br>The earl hesitated, then smiled. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t be all bad if you carry around cigars of this caliber.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I believe in being prepared for the rare occasion when one must wait out the excruciating boredom of wedding toasts given by people whom one barely knows.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Or people one knows too well,&#x201d; Blakeborough said morosely.<br> <br>Jeremy almost felt sorry for the chap.<br> <br>Almost. The earl was lucky not to have ended up married. Having a wife was a burden when a man was ill equipped to be a husband. &#x201c;What we really need to salvage the evening is some good brandy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah! Excellent idea.&#x201d; Blakeborough fished around in his coat pocket. &#x201c;I brought a flask.&#x201d; As he offered it to Jeremy, he added ruefully, &#x201c;One must also come prepared for when the wedding of one&#x2019;s former fianc�e becomes interminable.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jeremy swigged from the flask and handed it back. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised you came at all.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jane and I were never really romantic. Besides, I wanted her to know there were no hard feelings.&#x201d; His voice held an edge that belied his words. <br> <br>&#x201c;And that your pride wasn&#x2019;t damaged in the least.&#x201d;<br> <br>Blakeborough smiled stiffly. &#x201c;That played some small part in it, yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>They smoked a moment in silence, the muted sounds of sonorous voices barely penetrating their refuge. Then a burst of laughter made them both glance through the glass doors.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s when Jeremy saw her again&#x2014;his Juno, in the flesh. Thank God.<br> <br>&#x201c;Speaking of beautiful women,&#x201d; Jeremy said to Blakeborough, &#x201c;can you tell me the name of that one there in the emerald silk?&#x201d;<br> <br>The fellow looked over and blanched. &#x201c;Why do you want to know?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I want to paint her.&#x201d;<br> <br>The earl glared at him. &#x201c;That won&#x2019;t ever happen.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; Then the man&#x2019;s curt tone registered. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me&#x2014;you&#x2019;ve fixed on her as your future countess.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hardly. She&#x2019;s my sister.&#x201d;<br> <br>God rot it, that was worse. Sisters were sacrosanct. <br> <br>But Jeremy wasn&#x2019;t ready to give up. The earl appreciated good cigars, which showed him to be sensible. Maybe he could be made to see reason. &#x201c;Since I have a sister myself, I understand. I would strangle any unworthy fellow who went after mine. But my interest in yours is purely professional.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Forgive my candor, sir, but I&#x2019;ve seen your paintings. There&#x2019;s no way in hell I&#x2019;d let you paint my sister as one of your hopeless lunatics or seedy whores or whatever else you&#x2019;re thinking to make her.&#x201d;<br> <br>Damn. Admittedly, his work had turned rather bleak of late, but only because he&#x2019;d come to prefer depicting the raw drama of the real world rather than prettified history or wealthy ladies and gentlemen in fine attire. <br> <br>And his latest painting would not only be dark but violent. Not that he meant to tell the earl that. &#x201c;I can always disguise her features, change her hair color&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That won&#x2019;t work. In case you haven&#x2019;t noticed, Yvette is rather distinctive in appearance.&#x201d;<br> <br>Yvette. Even her name was exotic, which made him want her even more. For the painting. That&#x2019;s all. &#x201c;Exactly. She&#x2019;s arresting, and that makes for a good image.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, but to change her enough for her identity to be kept secret, you&#x2019;d have to turn her into another woman entirely. So you might as well go choose another woman.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want another woman. I want her.&#x201d;<br> <br>Blakeborough drank some brandy. &#x201c;Well, you can&#x2019;t have her. Between her argumentative nature and her &#x2018;arresting&#x2019; looks, she&#x2019;s had enough trouble finding suitors as it is. You paint her in one of your provocative scenes, and she&#x2019;ll die a spinster for certain.&#x201d;<br> <br>Incredulous, Jeremy stared through the window at her. &#x201c;A spinster!

It has wide-ranging general introductions, individual book introductions, a table of sources cited, maps, and informative notes. Compiled by the faculty of the University of Navarre, the commentaries draw on a huge variety of sources: Church documents, the writings of the Fathers and Doctors of the Church, and the work of prominent spiritual writers. Scholarly yet readable, the Navarre Bible commentaries offer a comprehensive intellectual, historical, and spiritual survey of the riches of the New Testament. They are a wonderful aid in the prayerful reading of Scripture (Lectio Divina).<p> This hardback edition is larger (7 x 10 inches) to accommodate much more extensive commentary than in the Compact Edition. The commentary is also new. It avoids repetition between the Synoptic Gospels and pays more attention to the sense of the text. The larger trim size and more ample margin allows for easier reading and note-taking.</p><p> This is the first edition of a Navarre New Testament with all of the following features:</p><p> - Commentary utilizing the Catechism of the Catholic Church and other recent Church documents including those of Pope Benedict XVI.<br> - Extensive New Testament commentary all in one volume; large-format<br> - Printed in two colors throughout (red and black)<br> - RSVCE (English) and New Vulgate (Latin) texts on the same page</p></p><p></p><h2>The Best American Short Stories</h2><p><p>The Best American Series� <br>First, Best, and Best-Selling <br><br>The Best American series is the premier annual showcase for the country&#x2019;s finest short fiction and nonfiction.

Although his primary interest was the esoteric tradition of Islam, Corbin was also a lifelong student of the theological works of Emanuel Swedenborg. The first essay, "<i>Mundus Imaginalis</i>, or The Imaginary and the Imaginal," clarifies Corbin's use of the term he coined, <i>mundus imaginalis</i>, or "the imaginal world." This important concept appears in both Swedenborgian and esoteric Islamic spirituality. The second piece, "Comparative Spiritual Hermeneutics," compares the revelation of the internal sense of the sacred boks of two distinct religions, Christianity and Islam.</p></p><p>Henry Corbin (1903-1978) held the chair in Islam at the Sorbonne form 1954 to 1974. He organized and was director of the department of Iranic studies at the Institut franco-iranien in Teheran. Gorbin wrote many books and articles, and edited numerous works in Persian of important Sufi and Isma&#x2019;ili authors<p>"By its nature, at the heart of a prophetic religion -- that is, a religion that professes the necessity of superhuman mediators between the divinity who inspires them and humanity as a whole -- there is the phenomenon of the Sacred Book that every prophet who has the quality of a Messenger (<i>morsal</i>, <i>rasul</i>) brings to man. This pehnomenon preeminently creates a "hermeneutic situation," the great issue being to know and understand the true meaning of the Book. It is on that point that, for a number of years, my research has drawn my attention to the common factors in the manner in which spiritual individuals, mystics or mystic theosophers, have read or read the Bible in Christianity and the Qur'an in Islam. I do not refer in any way here to the very famous medieval theory of the four meanings of the Scriptures (literal, moral, allegorical, and anagogic); this theory, in relation to our present subject, is as inoperative as it is harmless. The way of reading and comprehending to which I&nbsp;refer presupposes, in the strict sense of the word, a <i>theosophia</i>, that is the universes that are not discovered by means of syllogisms, because they do not reveal themselves except through a certain mode of cognition, a <i>hierognosis</i> that unites the speculative knowledge of traditional information to the most personal interior experience, for, in the absence of the latter, technical models alone would be transmitted, and these would be doomed to a rapid decline. It also happens that the truth of the hidden meaning is manifested from time to time as a new revelation under the inspiration of the Spirit; the hermeneutics are renewed; they accompany the recurrence of a certain number of archetypes, which attests in a way to the objectivity of the spiritual worlds on which these hermeneutics rely.</p><p>"Only two pinnacles can be considered in the course of this discussion. In the eighteenth century, in Christianity, the great Swedish visionary theosopher Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772) was truly, in his immense work, the prophet of the internal sense of the Bible -- and this spiritual sense has nothing to do with allegory. In Islam, on the other hand, there is the entire religious phenomenon of Shi'ism, which, whether in tis Twelve-Imam or Seven-Imam (Isma'ili) form, is based essentially on the spiritual hermeneutics of the Qur'an, on the esoteric sense of the prophetic Revelations."</p></p><h2>Money and Teens: Savvy Money Skills</h2><p>Don&#39;t take on the world without this book.

In short, none of us is perfect, and when we pretend to be, people quit listening to us. Instead, we need to focus on trying to connect with others. Leading Imperfectly is full of examples for how to make those connections. The book is divided into a series of short, often humorous, and always insightful essays filled with real-life stories from James&#39; own life. The through line for the book is the significance of practicing authentic leadership. The essays discuss topics such as realizing our story has value, the importance of love in leadership, how to prevent over-committing because you can&#39;t be everything to everyone, realizing you don&#39;t have all the answers, and some practical advice about the importance of valuing the time we have and giving that time to the most important people in our lives. James also challenges us to look at the lies we tell ourselves that hold us back in life, and to learn how to listen to others so they will listen to us. James&#39; humor provides comic relief in the middle of some of the more serious stories, but the humor always makes his examples hit home and keeps his stories memorable. Readers will appreciate that while he speaks as someone who has had success in life, his leadership background is not that of the typical leader who writes leadership books-he&#39;s not a former company CEO or a famous athlete-and that makes his points stand out all the more. Educators, business professionals, student leaders, and others will find this book to be introspective, validating, and motivational. Most importantly they will take away that their story is good enough. Check out Leading Imperfectly. Between the chuckles, there&#39;s quite a bit of wisdom that will stick with you long after you turn the last page.</p><p></p><h2>Invitation to Psychology</h2><p><i>For courses in Introductory Psychology</i> <br> <br> <b>Ask questions and be willing to wonder</b> <br> <b> <i>Invitation to Psychology</i>, 7th Edition</b> weaves scientific thinking and critical thinking into the fabric of psychological science.

And how much damage does it continue to do? The history of medicine begins with Hippocrates in the fifth century BC. Yet until the invention of antibiotics in the 1930s doctors, in general, did their patients more harm than good. In this fascinating new look at the history of medicine, David Wootton argues that for more than 2300 years doctors have relied on their patients&#39; misplaced faith in their ability to cure. Over and over again major discoveries which could save lives were met with professional resistance. And this is not just a phenomenon of the distant past. The first patient effectively treated with penicillin was in the 1880s; the second not until the 1940s. There was overwhelming evidence that smoking caused lung cancer in the 1950s; but it took thirty years for doctors to accept the claim that smoking was addictive. As Wootton graphically illustrates, throughout history and right up to the present, bad medical practice has often been deeply entrenched and stubbornly resistant to evidence. This is a bold and challenging book--and the first general history of medicine to acknowledge the frequency with which doctors do harm.</p><p><br><strong>David Wootton</strong> is Anniversay Professor of History at the University of York.

Within this context he develops a theory of invention based on Gestalt psychology and a concept of social evolution as continuous development from antiquity to the present. Emphasis is placed on the role of economic forces in the development of technology, with scientific concepts also playing an important role in bringing about change.<br>The latter part of the book focuses on the production and control of power in general, and in particular on a number of important operative mechanisms. Thus we read thought-provoking accounts of the technology of textile manufacture from primitive times, of water wheels and windmills, water clocks, and mechanical clocks, and the work of Leonardo da Vinci. The development of printing is carefully studied, not only for its intrinsic interest, but because of its importance for the history of science. Other topics include the production and application of power (1500&#x2013;1830), machine tools and quantity production, the production and distribution of power since 1832, and the role of Asia Minor as a source of techniques which dominated the Middle Ages and the modern period as well.<br>Thoroughly researched and cogently reasoned, <i>A History of Mechanical Inventions</i> belongs in the library of anyone interested in the history of science and invention, as well as the relationship of technology to economic and social history.<br>"Throughout the book there is constant proof of the author's wide learning and varied intellectual interests." &#x2014; <i>The New York Times</i></p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Minoans: Life in Bronze Age Crete</h2><p>Bang up to date, and thoroughly researched, Rodney Castleden&#39;s Minoans: Life in Bronze Age Crete here sues the results of recent research to produce a comprehensive new vision of the peoples of Minoan Crete.</p><p>Rodney Castleden has published widely on landscape processes and prehistory. His books include The Knossos Labyrinth, The Stonehenge People and Neolithic Britain, all published by Routledge.In this companion to The Knossos Labyrinth (Routledge, 1990), Castleden gives us an outline of the Minoan culture that, he alleges, is more consistent with recent archaeological evidence: that Knossos was a temple, not a palace, in which occurred not only athletic games and graceful rites, but also human sacrifice and other behaviors pointing to a previously unsuspected dark side to the Minoan personality; and that the Minoan world view and distinctive artistic vision were stimulated by the widespread eating of opium. His revision is not implausible. In early cultures the line between church and state tended to be hazy; so with its architecture. On the other hand, in his zeal to reexamine all traditional theories Castleden frequently proposes scenarios drawn more from psychosocial inference than evidence, yielding arguments less compelling than the originals. A nation of addicts could scarcely have had the energy to execute drug-induced creativity, much less to develop the commercial empire that was ancient Crete under the Minoans. Thought-provoking nonetheless.<br><i>-Jo-Ann D.

However, there is a modern religious movement in which the negative stereotype of the harlot is inverted and exalted.<em> The Eloquent Blood</em> focuses on the changing construction of femininity and feminine sexuality in interpretations of the goddess Babalon. A central deity in Thelema, the religion founded by the notorious British occultist Aleister Crowley (1875-1947), Babalon is based on Crowley's favorable reinterpretation of the biblical Whore of Babylon, and is associated with liberated female sexuality and the spiritual ideal of passionate union with existence.<br>Analyzing historical and contemporary written sources, qualitative interviews, and ethnographic fieldwork in the Anglo-American esoteric milieu, the study traces interpretations of Babalon from the works of Crowley and some of his key disciples--including the rocket scientist John "Jack" Whiteside Parsons, and the enigmatic British occultist Kenneth Grant--until the present. From the 1990s onwards, this study shows, female and LGBTQ esotericists have challenged historical interpretations of Babalon, drawing on feminist and queer thought and conceptualizing femininity in new ways. <br>Tracing the trajectory of a particular gendered symbol from the fin-de-si�cle until today, Manon Hedenborg White explores the changing role of women in Western esotericism, and shows how evolving constructions of gender have shaped the development of esotericism. Combining research on historical and contemporary Western esotericism with feminist and queer theory, the book sheds new light on the ways in which esoteric movements and systems of thought have developed over time in relation to political movements.<br></p><p><br><strong>Manon Hedenborg White</strong> holds a PhD in the History of Religions from Uppsala University (Sweden).

With an approach that is fresh, timely, challenging, and engaging, <strong>Ways of Social Change</strong> shows students how social change is both a lived experience and the result of our actions in the world. It invites the reader into the realm of social science, where clarification, understanding, and inquiry provide for both informed opinions and a path to effective involvement. The core of the book focuses on five forces that powerfully influence the direction, scope and speed of social change: science and technology, social movements, war and revolution, large corporations, and the state. A concluding chapter encourages students to examine their own perspectives and offers ways to engage in social change, now and in their lifetime.</p><p><p><strong>Garth Massey </strong>(PhD, Indiana University-Bloomington) is Professor Emeritus&nbsp;at the University of Wyoming where he was Director of International Studies (1998-2008) and a faculty member in Sociology (1974-2008).

In this important second book, Alison Games, a colonial American historian, explores the period from 1560 to 1660, when England challenged dominion over the American continents, established new long-distance trade routes in the eastern Mediterranean and the East Indies, and emerged in the 17th century as an empire to reckon with. Games discusses such topics as the men and women who built the colonial enterprise, the political and fiscal factors that made such growth possible, and domestic politics that fueled commercial expansion. Her cast of characters includes soldiers and diplomats, merchants and mariners, ministers and colonists, governors and tourists, revealing the surprising breath of foreign experiences ordinary English people had in this period. This book is also unusual in stretching outside Europe to include Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. A comparative imperial study and expansive world history, this book makes a lasting argument about the formative years of the English empire.<br></p><p><br><strong>Alison Games </strong>is Dorothy M.

Yet until now, little attention has been given to one of the most vital dimensions of their spirituality: their astute, penetrating interpretation of Scripture. Rooted in solitude, cultivated in an atmosphere of silence, oriented toward the practical appropriation of the sacred texts, the desert fathers' hermeneutic profoundly shaped every aspect of their lives and became a significant part of their legacy. This book explores the setting within which the early monastic movement emerged, the interpretive process at the center of the desert fathers' quest for holiness, and the intricate patterns of meaning woven into their words and their lives.<br></p><p>Douglas Burton-Christie is at Loyola Marymount University.<br>"Highly recommended for all serious collections of patristic church history, Christian spirituality, and fourth-century Roman mentality."--<em>Choice</em><p></p><br>"An excellent book that focuses attention on hermeneutical questions."--Brother Ray McManaman, FSL, <em>Lewis University</em><p></p><br>"[An] excellent scholarly work, superbly lucid as well as careful and thorough.

Cross-cultural influences are everywhere in evidence, in the food people eat, the clothes they wear, and in the places they worship. This was ever the case, and at no time more so than in the India that existed from 1200 to 1750, before the European intervention.

She has published Precolonial India in Practice: Society, Religion, and Identity in Medieval Andhra (2001)."India Before Europe" is not only up to date and deeply erudite, but it also presents a highly engaging narrative: thoughtful, accessible, and perfectly balanced between the 'forest' and the 'trees'. Asher and Talbot are acknowledged authorities in the field of medieval India, and their differing areas of expertise complement one another beautifully. The text moves seamlessly from discussions of political structure and social-economic history, to consideration of large scale cultural processes and the physical realis of architecture, painting, and textiles.

It was equally well-received by historical societies, garnering the Allan Nevins History Prize as well as a Bancroft Prize, the most prestigious history award of all. Now once again available, <em>Prelude to Civil War</em> is still the definitive work on the subject, and one of the most important in ante-bellum studies.<br> It tells the story of the Nullification Controversy in South Carolina, describing how from 1816 to 1836 aristocratic planters of the Palmetto State tumbled from a contented and prosperous life of elegant balls and fine Madeira wines to a world rife with economic distress, guilt over slavery, and apprehension of slave rebellion. It shows in compelling detail how this reversal of fortune led the political leaders of South Carolina down the path to ever more radical states rights doctrines: in 1832 they were seeking to nullify federal law by refusing to obey it; four years later some of them were considering secession.<br> As the story unfolds, we meet a colorful and skillfully drawn cast of characters, among them John C. Calhoun, who hoped nullifcation would save both his highest priority, slavery, and his next priority, union; President Andrew Jackson, who threatened to hang Calhoun and lead federal troops into South Carolina; Denmark Vesey, who organized and nearly brought off a slave conspiracy; and Martin Van Buren, the "Little Magician," who plotted craftily to replace Calhoun in Jackson's esteem. These and other important figures come to life in these pages, and help to tell a tale--often in their own words--central to an understanding of the war which eventually engulfed the United States.<br> Demonstrating how a profound sensitivity to the still-shadowy slavery issue--not serious economic problems alone--led to the Nullification Controversy, Freehling revises many theories previously held by historians. He describes how fear of abolitionists and their lobbying power in Congress prompted South Carolina's leaders to ban virtually any public discussion of the South's "peculiar institution," and shows that while the Civil War had many beginnings, none was more significant than this single, passionate controversy.<br> Written in a lively and eminently readable style, <em>Prelude to Civil War</em> is must reading for anyone trying to discover the roots of the conflict that soon would tear the Union apart.<br></p><p><br><strong>William W.

Certain &#34;closer-look&#34; sections and the entire NRSV translation are provided throughout the text as a convenience to the reader."Witherington has such felicitious turns of phrase and a manner of writing that makes reading such dense material delightful. I would especially recommend this book for faculty in the humanities who wish to learn about the Book of Revelation without getting bogged down in the usual inside exchange among biblical scholars; that sort of exclusive conversation does not happen in the text for its notes. I would also recommend this book to the biblical scholar who still thinks that the historical critical method is the only real tool at our disposal; W. has convincingly demonstrated that socio-rhetorical criticism can meaningfully enhance the findings of historical criticism (and, so, yes, Witherington has also shown that historical criticism is still the most fundamental tool in the box)." --Bryn Mawr Classical Review<br><br>"Written by a prolific evangelical scholar, this is a solid commentary on the New Testament's most enigmatic book. Witherington brings to this work his characteristic emphasis on the social context and literary stucture of the book in question. His extensive introduction is particularly helpful because it traces the history of interpretation of Revelation and charts where recent writings on the book stand. Along the way, the commentary is enhanced with explanations in bold print that take up particular historical issues or problems of interpretation." The Bible Today<br><br>"this commentary would serve as a useful introduction to one of the most complex books of the Bible. It is especially helpful for dealing with the practical value of the Apocalypse for the modern day. However, its brevity would demand that the preacher/teacher consult more extensive commentaries such as those of Osborne or Beale." - Mark D. Owens, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary<br><br>"Witherington offers a 'socio-rhetorical' approach, but does this by rooting Revelation in the first century. The commentary offers suggested reading early on, and this gives a good overview of scholarship on Revelation. Witherington appears to be in touch with the major streams of thinking in the areas noted above, and his commentary is impressively concise." --Ian Paul, The Expository Times<br><br>"...introduces the reader to recent mainstream, sound research on Revelation, it fruitfully engages in debate with questionable literalist readings, it opens the eyes for Revelation as a book of the first century, it applies responsible hermeneutical strategies, and, finally, it also assists readers who are interested in more contemporary application of its material." --Pieter G.R. de Villiers, University of the Free State: Neotestamentica<br><br>"Ben Witherington has written a well-informed commentary on John's Apocalypse that will aid undergraduates and other adult learners in exploring the texts in its ancient context...this commentary does a fine job of explicating a difficult biblical book in a way that is accessible to the intended audience." --Vincent Skemp, The College of St Catherine: The Catholic Bible Quarterly</p><h2>Punishment and Modern Society: A Study in Social Theory (Studies in Crime and Justice)</h2><p><p>In this path-breaking book, David Garland argues that punishment is a complex social institution that affects both social relations and cultural meanings. Drawing on theorists from Durkheim to Foucault, he insightfully critiques the entire spectrum of social thought concerning punishment, and reworks it into a new interpretive synthesis.<br> <br> "<i>Punishment and Modern Society</i> is an outstanding delineation of the sociology of punishment. At last the process that is surely the heart and soul of criminology, and perhaps of sociology as well&#x2014;punishment&#x2014;has been rescued from the fringes of these 'disciplines'. . . . This book is a first-class piece of scholarship."&#x2014;Graeme Newman, <i>Contemporary Sociology</i><br> <br> "Garland's treatment of the theorists he draws upon is erudite, faithful and constructive. . . . <i>Punishment and Modern Society</i> is a magnificent example of <i>working</i> social theory."&#x2014;John R. Sutton, <i>American Journal of Sociology</i><br> <br> "<i>Punishment and Modern Society</i> lifts contemporary penal issues from the mundane and narrow contours within which they are so often discussed and relocates them at the forefront of public policy. . . . This book will become a landmark study."&#x2014;Andrew Rutherford, <i>Legal Studies</i><br> <br> "This is a superbly intelligent study. Its comprehensive coverage makes it a genuine review of the field. Its scholarship and incisiveness of judgment will make it a constant reference work for the initiated, and its concluding theoretical synthesis will make it a challenge and inspiration for those undertaking research and writing on the subject.

Because this book is an analytical study, it stresses issues rather than men. It seeks to exhibit the sources of these issues and to show that some are unnecessary; that the rest gather into clusters and are interconnected in systems corresponding closely to the traditional schools of philosophy. The virtue of the root-metaphor method is that it puts metaphysics on a purely factual basis and pushes philosophical issues back to the interpretation of evidence.<br><br>This book was written primarily as a contribution to the field, but its plan excellently suits it for use as a text in courses in metaphysics, types of philosophical theory, or present tendencies in philosophy.</p><p><b>Stephen C.

Rather than presenting a gloom and doom report about the destruction of natural resources, Our Common Future offers an agenda advocating the growth of economies based on policies that do not harm, and can even enhance, the environment.

Those unfamiliar with Aquinas will find helpful introductions and guides, while even scholars will find useful hints and convincing corrections of time-honored mistakes. --Jeffrey Hause, Creighton University</p><br><br><p>This very readable and accurate translation of the so-called Treatise on Human Nature strikes the right balance between literal rendition of Aquinas' Latin and naturalness of English expression, and thus will be of use both to new students of Aquinas and to those familiar with the original Latin. The commentary on the text should make the translation especially suitable for use in courses on Aquinas&#x2019; philosophy of human nature and theory of knowledge. --Deborah Black, University of Toronto</p></p><h2>There Once Lived a Girl Who Seduced Her Sister&#39;s Husband, and He Hanged Himself: Love Stories</h2><p><b>Love stories, with a twist, by Russia&#x2019;s preeminent contemporary fiction writer&#x2014;the author of the prizewinning memoir about growing up in Stalinist Russia,&nbsp;<i>The Girl from the Metropol Hotel</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> By turns sly and sweet, burlesque and heartbreaking, these realist fables of women looking for love are the stories that Ludmilla Petrushevskaya&#x2014;who has been compared to Chekhov, Tolstoy, Beckett, Poe, Angela Carter, and even Stephen King&#x2014;is best known for in Russia.<br> &nbsp;<br> Here are attempts at human connection, both depraved and sublime, by people across the life span: one-night stands in communal apartments, poignantly awkward couplings, office trysts, schoolgirl crushes, elopements, tentative courtships, and rampant infidelity, shot through with lurid violence, romantic illusion, and surprising tenderness. With the satirical eye of Cindy Sherman, Petrushevskaya blends macabre spectacle with transformative moments of grace and shows just why she is Russia&#x2019;s preeminent contemporary fiction writer.</p><p><b>Ludmilla Petrushevskaya</b> was born in 1938 in Moscow, where she still lives.

Unfortunately, Christians seem equally confused, and the church has tended to respond with simplistic answers. The reason for this confusion is that the meaning of sex has been largely lost.<br><br>Dennis Hollinger argues that there is indeed a God-given meaning to sex. This meaning, found in the Christian worldview, provides a framework for a biblical sexual ethic that adequately addresses the many contemporary moral issues. <i>The Meaning of Sex </i>provides a good balance between accessible theology and engaging discussion of the practical issues Christians are facing, including premarital sex, sex within marriage, homosexuality, reproductive technologies, and faithful living in a sex-obsessed world.</p><p><b>Good Sex Is Found in the Meaning of Sex<br><br></b>In a culture deeply confused about sex and sexual ethics that often sends conflicting messages--at times promoting an "anything goes" attitude while at other times seeking to impose limits on sexual behavior--and a church that frequently responds with simplistic answers, the real meaning of sex has been largely lost. In this book, Dennis Hollinger counters the confusion, arguing for an inherent, God-given meaning to sex. This meaning provides a framework for a wholistic biblical sexual ethic that adequately addresses contemporary moral issues such as premarital sex, sex within marriage, homosexuality, reproductive technologies, and faithful living in a sex-saturated world.<br><br>"Dennis Hollinger addresses the complex issues of sexuality with a rare combination of theological-philosophical expertise, cultural savvy, and pastoral sensitivity. In doing so, he goes beyond general references to 'love and justice' to take seriously the specifics of what the Bible says about this most intimate area of our lives. <i>The Meaning of Sex</i> is a much-needed 'for such a time as this' book."--<b>Richard J. Mouw</b>, Fuller Theological Seminary<br><br>"Debates and dialogues about sexual ethics spin in circles unless we clarify 'the meaning of sex.' Indeed, what sets apart a truly Christian sexual ethic is that it is founded on the distinctive meanings of sex and sexuality established by God and revealed in the Scriptures. Hollinger's book articulates these foundations persuasively and then mines them to clarify the most pressing ethical and moral challenges facing the church today."--<b>Stanton L. Jones</b>, Wheaton College; author, <i>Ex-Gays?</i> and <i>God's Design for Sex<br><br></i>"One of the greatest needs today of young and old alike is to rediscover the liberating freedom that accompanies understanding and experiencing sex in all its God-ordained glory. Dennis Hollinger has given us what I believe to be the best contemporary treatment on this timely subject. This is not just a book for ethicists.

Roth's comic genius, his imaginative daring, his courage in exploring uncomfortable truths, and his assault on political, cultural, and sexual orthodoxies have made him one of the essential writers of our time. By special arrangement with the author, The Library of America continues the definitive edition of Roth's collected works. <br><br> This fourth volume presents the trilogy and epilogue that constitute <i>Zuckerman Bound</i> (1985), Roth's wholly original investigation into the unforeseen consequences of art-mainly in libertarian America and then, by contrast, in Soviet-suppressed Eastern Europe-during the latter half of the twentieth century. <i>The Ghost Writer</i> (1979) introduces Nathan Zuckerman in the 1950s, a budding writer infatuated with the Great Books, discovering the contradictory claims of literature and experience while an overnight guest in the secluded New England farmhouse of his literary idol, E. I. Lonoff. <i>Zuckerman Unbound</i> (1981) finds him far from Lonoff's domain-the scene is Manhattan as the sensationalizing 1960s are coming to an end. Zuckerman, in his mid-thirties, is suffering the immediate aftershock of literary celebrity. The high-minded prot?g? of E. I. Lonoff has become a notorious superstar. <i>The Anatomy Lesson</i> (1984) takes place largely in the hospital isolation ward that Zuckerman has made of his Upper East Side apartment. It is Watergate time, 1973, and to Zuckerman the only other American who seems to be in as much trouble as himself is Richard Nixon. Zuckerman, at forty, is beset with crippling and unexplained physical pain; he wonders if the cause might not be his own inflammatory work. In <i>The Prague Orgy</i> (1985), entries from Zuckerman's notebooks describing his 1976 sojourn among the outcast artists of Soviet-occupied Czechoslovakia reveal the major theme of Zuckerman Bound from a new perspective that provides the stinging conclusion to this richly ironic and intricately designed magnum opus. As an added feature, this volume publishes for the first time Roth's unproduced television screenplay for <i>The Prague Orgy</i>, featuring new characters and scenes that do not appear in the novella.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

He wrote&nbsp;to his numerous correspondents on these and other topics in prose that is celebrated for its charm, eloquence, and wit. This new Everyman's edition offers an extensive selection of Walpole's letters, helpfully arranged by subject so the reader can choose from themes including social life, the Court, politics, literature, and the evolution of his Gothic castle and art and book collections at Strawberry Hill. This edition offers new annotations throughout, with introductions to its various sections and a general introduction on Walpole as a letter writer. In addition, the text of the letters has been corrected and previously excised passages have been restored.</p><p><b>HORATIO WALPOLE,</b> 4th Earl of Orford (1717-1797), also known as Horace Walpole, was an English art historian, man of letters, antiquarian, printer/publisher, and Whig politician. He wrote the first gothic novel, <i>The Castle of Otranto,</i> and is famous for his correspondence and for his Gothic Revival villa, Strawberry Hill, and its vast art and book collections. <br><br><b>STEPHEN CLARKE</b> is a leading Walpole scholar. He is a Fellow of the Society of Antiquities, an Honorary Research Fellow of the University of Liverpool, and a trustee both of Strawberry Hill and of the Lewis Walpole Library at Yale University.from the INTRODUCTION:&nbsp;HORACE WALPOLE AND THE ART OF LETTER-WRITING<br>&nbsp;<br>The letters of Horace Walpole have always been recognized as one of the most outstanding collections of correspondence in English literature. Throughout his long life Walpole maintained an extensive correspondence with a wide circle of friends&#x2014;it is estimated that he may have written over seven thousand letters, of which some three thousand survive, and those figures exclude notes and letters of business. His letters open a window onto the eighteenth century and allow the reader to engage with the panorama of contemporary life: to listen to the talk, to hear the scandal, to participate in the debates, and to watch the events of the day unfold. What Walpole offers is a sense of immediacy, an unrivalled ability to re-create a scene and to tell a story, and that gift the modern reader can share with the letters&#x2019; original recipients.<br>&nbsp;<br>Walpole was insistent that letters should not be fine or studied, but should rather, as he explained to his friend Lady Ossory, be &#x2018;&#x2018;extempore conversations upon paper&#x2019;&#x2019;. But he was so well placed and had such broad interests that those conversations are extremely wide-ranging. As the son of Sir Robert Walpole, the prime minister, and a Member of Parliament himself for over twenty-five years, he knew and watched the politicians of the time and observed and participated in their schemes. As a young man on the Grand Tour he had thrown himself into ridottos and carnivals, and for the rest of his life he attended events of all kinds: from balls and routs to gatherings of the Bluestockings, and from the salons of Paris to Coronations and royal funerals and state trials. He moved freely through London society, meeting familiarly with statesmen, writers, artists, actors, scholars, historians, courtiers, and clerics. When he wrote about the unfolding dramas of his time, whether foreign wars or political upheavals, he did so with personal knowledge of many of the actors involved. We can hear from him the conversation of the wits and celebrities of the day, and observe its cultural life: as an historian and writer he was engaged with and had informed views on contemporary art and architecture, on the latest novel and the newest play. In addition, the letters reveal much of his own complex personality, of his friendships and achievements, and of the extraordinary house that he created at Strawberry Hill and filled with his collections.<br>&nbsp;<br>The variety of Walpole&#x2019;s various correspondents reflected the range of his contacts and activities, and each series of letters has its own centre of gravity and dynamic. The letters are as informal as any conversation with its asides and incidental digressions, but there are recurrent themes to individual correspondences, whether politics, or literature, or social life, or antiquarianism. Perhaps the most striking example of this is the largest of all Walpole&#x2019;s series of letters, that written to Sir Horace Mann, the British plenipotentiary at Florence. From 1740 about two thousand letters passed between them. Walpole did not see Mann after staying with him in Florence in 1741, but they wrote to each other regularly until Mann&#x2019;s death forty-five years later. Mann needed news of British politics and policy, and of world affairs that might impact on the court of the Duke of Tuscany. This Walpole supplied, interspersing it with incident and entertaining detail on the talking-points of the moment. Mann responded with a picture of evolving Florentine society, of the cares of his official duties (which included benignly overseeing the endless succession of young men passing through Florence on their Grand Tour) and the rigours of the gout to which, like Walpole, he was a martyr. Walpole knew the charm and value of anecdotal asides, and lamented that Mann&#x2019;s residence abroad meant he could only employ them sparingly. He noted to Lady Ossory (herself isolated from London society after a scandalous divorce) that &#x2018;&#x2018;Nothing is so pleasant as the occurrences of society in a letter. I am always regretting in my correspondence with Madame du Deffand and Sir Horace Mann, that I must not make use of them, as the one has never lived in England, and the other not these fifty years, and so any private stories would want notes as much as Petronius. Sir Horace and I have no acquaintance in common but the kings and queens of Europe.&#x2019;&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>Principally, however, Walpole provided Mann with news, and his ability to provide news, or frustration in its absence, is a leitmotif throughout their correspondence. On occasion he plays with his correspondents, as when he suggests to Lord and Lady Hertford (newly arrived in Paris on Hertford&#x2019;s appointment as British Ambassador) in letter 207: &#x2018;&#x2018;Consider you are in my power. You, by this time, are longing to hear from England, and depend upon me for the news of London. I shall not send you a tittle, if you are not very good, and do not (one of you, at least) write to me punctually.&#x2019;&#x2019; Similar gestures as to the power of giving or withholding information can be seen in the opening of letter 277 to Mann on the victory of Culloden (&#x2018;&#x2018;You have bid me for some time to send you good news &#x2013; well ! I think I will. How good would you have it?&#x2019;&#x2019;), and again in letter 293 to Hertford on the Wilkes riots, where Walpole opens his letter by asking &#x2018;&#x2018;Well ! but we have had a prodigious riot: are you not impatient to know the particulars?&#x2019;&#x2019; It is through his access to news that Walpole controlled his correspondences &#x2013; hence his irritation when in later life he became dependent on newspapers that were as readily available to his recipient.<br>&nbsp;<br>The letters to Mann evolved into a prospect of the eighteenth-century world, as seen from London and Strawberry Hill and delivered to Florence. Walpole was aware of their significance, and from as early as 1748 asked Mann to give him back his letters: the first set was returned the following year, the last following Mann&#x2019;s death in 1786. From 1754 Walpole started to prepare transcripts of the letters, on occasion pruning some of the text, and adding explanatory footnotes. He then delegated the task of transcription to his secretary Thomas Kirgate (who also conducted the printing press Walpole had established at Strawberry Hill), and ultimately there were six folio volumes of transcripts: it is these, rather than his original letters to Mann, which have survived. To the first of these volumes Walpole attached the following Advertisement:<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The following collection of letters, written very carelessly by a young man, had been preserved by the person to whom they were addressed. The author, some years after the date of the first, borrowed them, on account of some anecdotes interspersed. On the perusal, among many trifling relations and stories which were only of consequence or amusing to the two persons concerned in the correspondence, he found some facts, characters and news, which, though below the dignity of history, might prove entertaining to many other people: and knowing how much pleasure, not only himself, but many other persons have often found in a series of private and familiar letters, he thought it worth his while to preserve these, as they contain something of the customs, fashions, politics, diversions and private history of several years; which, if worthy of any existence, can be properly transmitted to posterity, only in this manner.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>This introductory note is typically Walpolian in its familiar, relaxed tone and its underlying seriousness. Walpole&#x2019;s letters were not studied, but neither were they ever careless. He employs a tone of self-deprecation, apologising for the trifling nature of some of the letters, but that self-deprecation was a mask he often wore when most earnest, and is a pose that appears recurrently in his correspondence. Compare, for example, the hauteur of his dismissal of authorship (&#x2018;&#x2018;there is nothing I hold so cheap as a learned man, except an unlearned one&#x2019;&#x2019;) in letter 242 to his assessment of his limitations as an author in letter 124 (&#x2018;&#x2018;I have learnt and have practised the humiliating task of comparing myself with great authors; and that comparison has annihilated all the flattery that self-love could suggest&#x2019;&#x2019;). Walpole scorned the trade of &nbsp;authorship, and claimed to regret having ventured his reputation in the marketplace, but was nonetheless fully aware of the value both of the works he published and the rich body of letters that he sent to his friends. He understood the significance of his correspondence with Mann and went to great trouble to preserve it, as he believed that &#x2018;&#x2018;nothing gives so just an idea of an age as genuine letters; nay, history waits for its last seal from them.&#x2019;&#x2019; But he also held it &#x2018;&#x2018;cruel to publish private letters, while the persons concerned in them are living.&#x2019;&#x2019; Consequently none of his letters was published in his lifetime, but he clearly envisaged publication for the Mann letters and at least some of the others, and hoped that what he described in letter 134 as &#x2018;&#x2018;that undutiful urchin, Posterity&#x2019;&#x2019; would value the portrait of his age he provided. In the words of R. W. Ketton-Cremer, still after over seventy-five years Walpole&#x2019;s finest and most sensitive biographer, &#x2018;&#x2018;It is impossible to exaggerate either his solicitude for posterity, or the skill with which he ensured that his varied records should reach posterity in the most complete and attractive form.&#x2019;&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>Walpole left his papers to the father of his young friend Mary Berry, knowing that she would duly edit his collected <i>Works</i>: five large quarto volumes appeared the year after his death. The last two volumes of the <i>Works </i>included Walpole&#x2019;s correspondence with Richard West and Thomas Gray, and his letters to his cousin Henry Conway, the artist Richard Bentley, the amateur architect John Chute, Lord Strafford, Lady Hervey, Lady Ailesbury, and Hannah More. With the exception of More, all these correspondents had already died, and Walpole&#x2019;s letters to More, which respect her personal piety, were unexceptionable by any standards. The letters were lightly annotated by Berry as editor but also have a sprinkling of notes by Walpole, who clearly in old age planned their forming a part of his published <i>Works</i>, the monument to his literary achievement. <br>&nbsp;<br>But as a young man Walpole was not writing with publication in mind, and the charm of his letters lies in their unstudied informality and spontaneity. Walpole himself once admonished his friend George Montagu for praising his letters: &#x2018;&#x2018;it sounds as if I wrote them to be fine and to have them printed, which might be very well for Mr. Pope who having wrote pieces carefully, which ought to be laboured, could carry off the affectation of having studied things that have no excuse but their being wrote flying.&#x2019;&#x2019; Alexander Pope was known to have taken great trouble to prepare his literary correspondence for publication, and Walpole contrasts Pope&#x2019;s artifice with letters that should be &#x2018;&#x2018;wrote flying.&#x2019;&#x2019; The minor adjustments he made in transcribing the Mann letters were modest indeed in comparison with the wholesale amendments undertaken not only by Pope, but also by other writers such as Anna Seward, a provincial author who left behind her carefully arranged correspondence in the vain hope that it would bolster her fading reputation, and Walpole&#x2019;s friend the Reverend William Mason, who cut and even transferred text between letters when editing the correspondence of Thomas Gray. Such re-ordering was permissible by the standards of the day, but correspondence consciously prepared for publication inevitably loses the freshness of unguarded intimacy. Walpole celebrated that intimacy in a letter of 8 October 1777 to Lady Ossory, written at a time when he was distracted by the financial affairs of his nephew (see letters 185 to 188):<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I have time to write to nobody, but on business, or to a few that are used to my ways, and with whom I don&#x2019;t mind whether I stand on my head or my heels &#x2013; I beg your Honour&#x2019;s pardon, for you are one to whom I can write comfortably . . . but since neither Aristotle nor Bossu have laid down rules for letters, and consequently have left them to their native wildness, I shall persist in saying whatever comes uppermost, and the less I am understood by anybody but the person I write to, so much the better.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The artist Richard Bentley described both Walpole&#x2019;s ease and familiarity of tone, and his care to recover his original letters: &#x201c;Mr. Bentley said that Walpole was the best letter-writer that ever took pen in hand; that he wrote with the greatest ease imaginable, with company in the room, and even talking to other people at the time: that he had a great loss when, some time ago, he demanded all his letters of him, which were sent to him, and refused returning those of his writing.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Montagu, who lived in the depths of the country and rarely put himself to the trouble of travelling to London, similarly praised Walpole&#x2019;s correspondence, claiming: &#x201c;Your last letter is always the best and most charming; if you would promise me to write every week I would never come to town as long as I lived. Think that I have a box full of them of above twenty years old; think what a treasure they will be a hundred years hence . . . Look you, Sir, they are my property; you may burn your own works but you shall as soon burn me as make me burn them.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Montagu was charming and witty, and Walpole was very fond of him, but he was also idle. His enthusiasm for receiving Walpole&#x2019;s effervescent dispatches of news and gossip faded, and his replies became more irregular (the opening of letter 111 and the conclusion of letter 122 show Walpole&#x2019;s mounting frustration) and eventually in 1770 died away. This does raise the question of what it must have been like to receive a steady flow of sparkling letters from Walpole: how could one compete? Dr. Johnson in his correspondence repeatedly lamented that the pleasure of receiving a letter was qualified by the sense of obligation that one must compose a letter in reply. The letters of some of Walpole&#x2019;s correspondents, particularly those who were writers or scholars, are of real interest, but it has never been suggested that figures such as Lady Ossory, secluded in the Bedfordshire countryside, could even begin to match him for matter or manner.<br>&nbsp;<br>Montagu and Ossory were both isolated in the provinces, and Walpole&#x2019;s letters provided them with news of the social life of London that they were denied. Walpole&#x2019;s correspondence with Lady Ossory only takes off in 1771, at least ten years after he had met her, but the year after his letters to Montagu finally dried up. It has been suggested that Walpole consciously chose his correspondents with a view to whatever aspect of his age his letters to them could display: when he lost Montagu, he found a replacement in Lady Ossory, so the record of contemporary life could be maintained. Beneath all this was an element of tension between Walpole&#x2019;s desire to record the incidents of the day, and his concern that the freedom of his letters would be curtailed if he felt that his letters were preserved and shown: &#x2018;&#x2018;Can I say everything, that comes into<br>my head, to Lady Ossory, if Posterity stands behind my chair and peeps over my shoulder?&#x2019;&#x2019; <br>&nbsp;<br>It ...</p><h2>What&#39;s God Got to Do with It?: Robert Ingersoll on Free Thought, Honest Talk and the Separation of Church and State</h2><p><p>Robert Ingersoll (1833&#x2014;1899) is one of the great lost figures in United States history, all but forgotten at just the time America needs him most. An outspoken and unapologetic agnostic, fervent champion of the separation of church and state, and tireless advocate of the rights of women and African Americans, he drew enormous audiences in the late nineteenth century with his lectures on &#x201c;freethought.&#x201d; His admirers included Mark Twain and Thomas A. Edison, who said Ingersoll had &#x201c;all the attributes of a perfect man&#x201d; and went so far as to make an early recording of Ingersoll&#x2019;s voice.</p><p>The publication of <i>What&#x2019;s God Got to Do with It? </i>will return Robert Ingersoll and his ideas to American political discourse. Edited and with a biographical introduction by Pulitzer Prize winner Tim Page, this new popular collection of Ingersoll&#x2019;s thought &#x2013; distilled from the twelve-volume set of his works, his copious letters, and various newspaper interviews &#x2013; promises to put Ingersoll back where he belongs, in the forefront of independent American thought.</p></p><p><p>Tim Page is the Pulitzer Prize&#x2014;winning chief music critic for the Washington Post. He is the author of <i>Dawn Powell: A Biography</i> and editor of <i>The Diaries of Dawn Powell</i> (Steerforth Press, 1995) and <i>Selected Letters of Dawn Powell</i>.</p>Robert Ingersoll belongs to that group of popular 19th-century lecturers who have faded from public consciousness because they failed to leave behind a written masterpiece. But Tim Page, The Washington Post's music critic and the editor of What's God Got To Do With It? Robert Ingersoll on Free Thought, Honest Talk &amp; the Separation of Church and State (Steerforth; paperback, $10), claims, "He does not deserve his present obscurity," and the well-chosen nuggets here put him right back on center stage. <p>Born in upstate New York in 1833 to a Congregational minister, Ingersoll was raised in a house of fiery fundamentalism, which he abandoned as soon as possible. But he retained his intimate knowledge of the Bible and theology and used it strategically for the rest of his life to slash away at what he considered the pernicious superstitions of religion. </p><p>Commemorating the centennial of the Declaration of Independence, he told his audience: "In 1776 our fathers endeavored to retire the gods from politics. . . . It was a notice to all churches and priests that thereafter mankind would govern and protect themselves. Politically it tore down every altar and denied the authority of every 'sacred book,' and appealed from the Providence of God to the Providence of Man." As Page acknowledges, "Even 130 years later, one cannot imagine any traditional politician speaking such words and remaining in the game for very long." Indeed, Ingersoll, whom Page calls "our apostle of heterodoxy," left a promising political career (as a Republican!) and "spent the last quarter century of his life as a peripatetic, Socratic gadfly, stinging fundamentalist American wherever and whenever he could." </p><p>In this collection of short excerpts from his speeches, interviews and newspaper articles, the patron saint of free thought celebrates human reason and decries the influence of blind faith. Opponents of the Kansas Board of Education, federal funding for church social programs and faith-based restrictions on medical research will find here the inspiration to keep fighting.</p><p>The Radicalism of Robert Ingersoll <br>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post.

He reveals the impediments that still stand in the way of open, equal dialogue between Africans and Europeans, between blacks and whites, but also instills us with hope that they will soon be overcome.</p><p><b>Chinua Achebe&nbsp;</b>(1930&#x2013;2013)<b>&nbsp;</b>was born in Nigeria. Widely considered to be the father of modern African literature, he is best known for his masterful African Trilogy, consisting of&nbsp;<i>Things Fall Apart, Arrow of God</i>, and&nbsp;<i>No Longer at Ease</i>. The trilogy tells the story of a single Nigerian community over three generations from first colonial contact to urban migration and the breakdown of traditional cultures.

[Achebe is] a powerful voice for cultural decolonization."&#x2014;<i>The Village Voice</i></p><h2>Egg and Spoon</h2><p><b>In this tour de force, master storyteller Gregory Maguire offers a dazzling novel for fantasy lovers of all ages.</b><br><br>Elena Rudina lives in the impoverished Russian countryside. Her father has been dead for years. One of her brothers has been conscripted into the Tsar&#x2019;s army, the other taken as a servant in the house of the local landowner. Her mother is dying, slowly, in their tiny cabin. And there is no food. But then a train arrives in the village, a train carrying untold wealth, a cornucopia of food, and a noble family destined to visit the Tsar in Saint Petersburg &#x2014; a family that includes Ekaterina, a girl of Elena&#x2019;s age. When the two girls&#x2019; lives collide, an adventure is set in motion, an escapade that includes mistaken identity, a monk locked in a tower, a prince traveling incognito, and &#x2014; in a starring role only Gregory Maguire could have conjured &#x2014; Baba Yaga, witch of Russian folklore, in her ambulatory house perched on chicken legs.</p><p><b>Gregory Maguire</b> is the author of the incredibly popular books in the Wicked Years series, including <i>Wicked:</i> <i>The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West, </i>which inspired the musical. He is also the author of several books for children, including <i>What-the-Dickens,</i> a <i>New York Times </i>bestseller. Gregory Maguire lives outside Boston.Though the story bears some marks of a heroic quest, it is really a series of dreamy, expertly painted vignettes, set pieces both absurd and spectacular. ... Maguire&#x2019;s wit is shown to best advantage when in sync with his lush whimsy... In this surfeit of myth and mayhem, there are also moments of poignant quiet, when the grand quest of saving the magic of Russia recedes. In these moments, the human comes to the fore, and our focus narrows once more to a child longing for a parent, a mother longing for a child, the aching burden of living through suffering that life demands again and again. ... It is impossible not to root for girls and watches and aunts alike, and to cheer their little victories as acts of grace.<br>&#x2014;The New York Times Book Review<br><br>Maguire marries the traditional &#x201c;Prince and the Pauper&#x201d; narrative to the Russian folktale of Baba Yaga with his trademark wit and aplomb. His lyrical descriptions of the drab countryside are equally detailed and moving as the charmed, floating courts of the Romanov dynasty. Each character is well-drawn and fascinating... The author weaves a lyrical tale full of magic and promise, yet checkered with the desperation of poverty and the treacherous prospect of a world gone completely awry. Egg and Spoon is a beautiful reminder that fairy tales are at their best when they illuminate the precarious balance between lighthearted childhood and the darkness and danger of adulthood.<br>&#x2014;School Library Journal (starred review)<br><br>An epic rich with references, aphorisms and advice.

Harry wiped away the tears.<br><br>That Saturday morning, crisp, clear, and beautiful, had held the alluring promise of a perfect May 29. The promise just curdled.<br><br>Harry had finished her early-morning chores and, despite a list of projects, decided to take a walk for an hour. She followed Potlicker Creek to see if the beavers had built any new dams. Barry was sprawled at the creek's edge on a dirt road two miles from her farm that wound up over the mountains into adjoining Augusta County. It edged the vast land holdings of Tally Urquhart, who, well into her nineties and spry, loathed traffic. Three cars constituted traffic in her mind. The only time the road saw much use was during deer-hunting season in the fall.<br><br>"Tucker, Mrs. Murphy, and Pewter, stay. I'm going to run to Tally's and phone the sheriff."<br><br>If Harry hit a steady lope, crossed the fields and one set of woods, she figured she could reach the phone in Tally's stable within fifteen minutes, though the pitch and roll of the land including one steep ravine would cost time.<br><br>As she left her animals, they inspected Barry.<br><br>"What could rip his throat like that? A bear swipe?" Pewter's pupils widened.<br><br>"Perhaps." Mrs. Murphy, noncommittal, sniffed the gaping wound, as did Tucker.<br><br>The cat curled her upper lip to waft more scent into her nostrils. The dog, whose nose was much longer and nostrils larger, simply inhaled.<br><br>"I don't smell bear," Tucker declared. "That's an overpowering scent, and on a morning like this it would stick."<br><br>Pewter, who cherished luxury and beauty, found that Barry's corpse disturbed her equilibrium. "Let's be grateful we found him today and not three days from now."<br><br>"Stop jabbering, Pewter, and look around, will you? Look for tracks."<br><br>Grumbling, the gray cat daintily stepped down the dirt road. "You mean like car tracks?"<br><br>"Yes, or animal tracks," Mrs. Murphy directed, then returned her attention to Tucker. "Even though coyote scent isn't as strong as bear, we'd still smell a whiff. Bobcat? I don't smell anything like that. Or dog. There are wild dogs and wild pigs back in the mountains. The humans don't even realize they're there."<br><br>Tucker cocked her perfectly shaped head. "No dirt around the wound. No saliva, either."<br><br>"I don't see anything. Not even a birdie foot," Pewter, irritated, called out from a hundred yards down the road.<br><br>"Well, go across the creek then and look over there." Mrs. Murphy's patience wore thin.<br><br>"And get my paws wet?" Pewter's voice rose.<br><br>"It's a ford. Hop from rock to rock. Go on, Pewt, stop being a chicken."<br><br>Angrily, Pewter puffed up, tearing past them to launch herself over the ford. She almost made it, but a splash indicated she'd gotten her hind paws wet.<br><br>If circumstances had been different, Mrs. Murphy and Tucker would have laughed. Instead, they returned to Barry.<br><br>"I can't identify the animal that tore him up." The tiger shook her head.<br><br>"Well, the wound is jagged but clean. Like I said, no dirt." Tucker studied the folds of flesh laid back.<br><br>"He was killed lying down," the cat sagely noted. "If he was standing up, don't you think blood would be everywhere?"<br><br>"Not necessarily," the dog replied, thinking how strong heartbeats sent blood straight out from the jugular. Tucker was puzzled by the odd calmness of the scene.<br><br>"Pewter, have you found anything on that side?"<br><br>"Deer tracks. Big deer tracks."<br><br>"Keep looking," Mrs. Murphy requested.<br><br>"I hate it when you're bossy." Nonetheless, Pewter moved down the dirt road heading west.<br><br>"Barry was such a nice man." Tucker mournfully looked at the square-jawed face, wide-open eyes staring at heaven.<br><br>Mrs. Murphy circled the body. "Tucker, I'm climbing up that sycamore. If I look down maybe I'll see something."<br><br>Her claws, razor sharp, dug into the thin surface of the tree, strips of darker outer bark peeling, exposing the whitish underbark. The odor of fresh water, of the tufted titmouse above her, all informed her. She scanned around for broken limbs, bent bushes, anything indicating Barry--other humans or large animals--had traveled to this spot avoiding the dirt road.<br><br>"Pewter?"<br><br>"Big fat nothing." The gray kitty noted that her hind paws were wet. She was getting little clods of dirt stuck between her toes. This bothered her more than Barry did. After all, he was dead. Nothing she could do for him. But the hardening brown earth between her toes, that was discomfiting.<br><br>"Well, come on back. We'll wait for Mom." Mrs. Murphy dropped her hind legs over the limb where she was sitting. Her hind paws reached for the trunk, the claws dug in, and she released her grip, swinging her front paws to the trunk. She backed down.<br><br>Tucker touched noses with Pewter, who had recrossed the creek more successfully this time.<br><br>Mrs. Murphy came up and sat beside them.<br><br>"Hope his face doesn't change colors while we're waiting for the humans. I hate that. They get all mottled." Pewter wrinkled her nose.<br><br>"I wouldn't worry." Tucker sighed.<br><br>In the distance they heard sirens.<br><br>"Bet they won't know what to make of this, either," Tucker said.<br><br>"It's peculiar." Mrs. Murphy turned her head in the direction of the sirens.<br><br>"Weird and creepy." Pewter pronounced judgment as she picked at her hind toes, and she was right.<br>2<br>Crozet was the last stop on the railroad before the locomotive disappeared into the first of the four tunnels Claudius Crozet had dug through the Blue Ridge Mountains. This feat, accomplished before dynamite, was considered one of the seven engineering wonders of the world in the mid-nineteenth century. At the beginning of the twenty-first century they were still wonders as two remained in use; the other two were closed but not filled in.<br><br>On the other side of the Blue Ridge Mountains reposed the fertile and long Shenandoah Valley, running from Winchester, Virginia, by the West Virginia line all the way to North Carolina. The Allegheny Mountains bordered the huge valley to the west.<br><br>But on the eastern slopes of the Blue Ridge Mountains the land, although not as fertile, could be quite good in patches.<br><br>Harry's tidy farm rested on one of those patches. Although lacking the thousands of acres of Tally Urquhart, she owned four hundred acres, give or take, plus she had kept her tobacco allotments current, allotments secured by her late father shortly after World War II. Still, like many a Southerner and especially a Virginian, Harry was land poor: good land, little cash.<br><br>Deputy Cynthia Cooper drove down the long drive with Harry in the front seat, her animals in the back of the squad car, stones crunching underneath her tires.<br><br>"House or barn?"<br><br>"House. Did my barn chores. Want coffee or tea?"<br><br>"Love coffee." Cooper stopped, cut the motor as Harry opened the doors for Mrs. Murphy, Pewter, and Tucker. The animals raced ahead, ducking through the animal door on the side of the screened door and then through the second animal door in the kitchen door.<br><br>Harry and Cooper followed them.<br><br>"Ten-thirty. I hadn't paid attention to the time." She ground coffee beans in the electric grinder as she put up water for tea. Harry loved the smell of coffee but couldn't drink it, as it made her too jumpy. "There's corn bread in the fridge. Miranda made a mess of it yesterday."<br><br>Miranda Hogendobber, a lady in her sixties, worked with Harry at the tiny Crozet Post Office, where Harry was postmistress.<br><br>The light inside the refrigerator illuminated Cooper's badge. She pulled out the corn bread and some sweet butter.<br><br>"Applesauce?"<br><br>Harry nodded. "Church of the Holy Light."<br><br>Last fall the applesauce had been cooked up to perfection by the ladies of the small church to which Miranda belonged. Harry attended St. Luke's Lutheran Church, where her friend the Reverend Herbert Jones was the pastor. She sat on the Parish Guild, impressing other, older members with her organizational skills.<br><br>"Here." Harry refilled the cats' dried-food bowl, then reached into a large stoneware cookie jar to give Tucker a smoked pig's ear.<br><br>"Thank you." The corgi solemnly took the tasty ear, remaining in the kitchen to chew it because she didn't want to miss anything.<br><br>"You okay?"<br><br>"Why wouldn't I be?"<br><br>"It's not every day you find a dead man."<br><br>"Dying. He was dying when we reached him. Yeah, I'm okay. I feel terrible for him, but I'm okay."<br><br>"Gurgling." Pewter added the vivid detail.<br><br>"Right." Cooper opened a drawer, grabbed two blue and yellow linen napkins, placing them by the plates. A country person herself, Cooper understood that country people lived much closer to life and death than most urban or suburban people.<br><br>"It was good of Rick to allow you to take me home. I could have walked."<br><br>Rick Shaw was sheriff of Albemarle County, an elected position and one growing ever more difficult as more wealthy people moved to this most beautiful place. Wealthy people tend to be very demanding. He was understaffed, underappreciated, and underpaid, but he loved law enforcement and did the best with what he had.<br><br>"Rick's more flexible than people realize," Cooper replied. "Once he'd inspected the corpse, questioned you, no reason to keep you. Another thing about Rick, he doesn't miss much," she said. "I hope the autopsy will reveal something. No sign of struggle. No sign that he dragged himself there." Cooper's blond eyebrows pointed upward as her mind turned over events.<br><br>"I know."<br><br>"And no scent." Tucker spoke with her mouth full.<br><br>"So handsome." Cooper sighed as she sat down while Harry served her a big mug of coffee, then took a striped creamer from the fridge and poured some of the rich eggshell-colored Devon cream into Cooper's coffee.<br><br>"Every now and then a girl has to treat herself to the best." Harry put the creamer on the checkered tablecloth as she sat down.<br><br>"Enemies--Barry?" Cooper knew Harry would know.<br><br>"He used to run with a wild crowd, but when he and Sugar started the business over at St. James Farm he sobered up."<br><br>"Sex, drugs, and rock and roll." Cooper reached for more corn bread.<br><br>"He was so good-looking and easygoing that he got away with a lot. 'Course, when his father wrapped his Nissan truck around a tree and died, that started to sober up Barry. He hasn't any family left. When he started the breeding operation he really cleaned up his act."<br><br>"I recall he left a trail of broken hearts." Cooper sipped her delicious coffee. "The last one was, uh . . ."<br><br>"Carmen Gamble. She was mad enough to kill him six months ago."<br><br>"But not strong enough to bite his throat out," Cooper added. "For all we know a mad dog bit his throat."<br><br>"Maybe."<br><br>"Boy, what a way to go." Cooper thoughtfully paused a moment.<br><br>"If I came up on Susan breathing her last, I'd--" Harry paused. "I think I'd never be the same."<br><br>Susan Tucker was Harry's best friend, married to a successful lawyer. They had one son at Cornell and a daughter in high school.<br><br>"Makes you wonder about war. Fifty-one thousand dead at Gettysburg. People get used to it. Or the siege of St. Petersburg, Leningrad. You just get used to it."<br><br>"I don't know if I could ever get used to the smell."<br><br>"Yeah, that's worse than the sight, for sure. Helps if you don't breathe through your nose."<br><br>"Certainly makes you understand why soldiers smoke--kills the odor a little bit and soothes your nerves." Harry noticed a flaming red cardinal swoop by the kitchen window, heading for the large bird feeder hanging in the old tree by the kitchen.<br><br>"That's another thing: Humans will drink, take drugs, anything to feel better. If you knew how many little drug busts we do . . . I mean, they aren't exactly selling kilos of marijuana, but the law states it's a crime and so I bust these guys. I can't keep up with it and it doesn't work, but it sure has made me think about why so many people do stuff."<br><br>"Cooper, that's easy. It feels good. Their body chemistry is a little different from yours and mine. Booze makes me sick. But for someone else, it's heaven--temporarily."<br><br>"Well, I'm thinking about drugs and alcohol in a new way. You and I know we're going to die. Humans carry around all this anxiety that stems from that original anxiety: the knowledge of death. Hence drugs and drink. You don't see Mrs. Murphy lapping up rum."<br><br>"Tastes awful. But give me some catnip." Mrs. Murphy's green eyes brightened.<br><br>"I never thought about that. Coop, you're a philosopher."<br><br>"No, just a cop." She finished her third piece of corn bread. "I'm surprised you haven't called Susan or Miranda or Fair." Fair was Harry's ex-husband, who remained a dear friend. In fact, she was thinking how much a part of her life he was and, hopefully, would always be.<br><br>"Thought I'd wait until you left. Is anything off-limits?"<br><br>"No. We don't even know enough to hold back evidence." Cooper winked. "Not that Rick would ever do such a thing."<br><br>"Right." Harry smiled. "How's he doing? I haven't seen him for a while except for today."<br><br>"He's been down at the courthouse engaged in the battle of the budget."<br><br>"No wonder I haven't seen him. Hey, to change the subject, have you heard anything about the new post office being built?"<br><br>"No more than you have. The population increase even out here in Crozet warrants a larger building."</p><h2>I Suffer Not a Woman: Rethinking I Timothy 2:11-15 in Light of Ancient Evidence</h2><p>Solid scriptural and archaeological evidence refutes the traditional interpretation used to bar women from leadership.</p><p><b>Richard Clark Kroeger</b> is a retired pastor and college professor. <b>Catherine Clark Kroeger </b>is founder and president emerita of Christians for Biblical Equality and is an adjunct professor of classical and ministry studies at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary.

There is no one book that exposes Westcott and Hort&#39;s false Greek Text and false Greek theory behind that text any more thoroughly and convincingly than The Revision Revised. Dean Burgon defends the traditional text of the New Testament. He shows clearly the defects in both manuscript &#34;B&#34; (Vaticanus) and manuscript &#34;Aleph&#34; (Sinaiticus). It is very important to see the arguments contained in this historic volume because virtually the same Greek text of Westcott and Hort (1881) FORMS THE BASIS OF ALMOST ALL OF THE MODERN VERSIONS AND PERVERSIONS. See the Appendix, pages 2-3.</p><p>[This selection is from Article 2--The New English Version.] Whatever may be urged in favour of Biblical Revision, it is at least undeniable that the undertaking involves a tremendous risk. Our Authorized Version is the one religious link which at present binds together ninety millions of English-speaking men scattered over he earth's surface. Is it reasonable that so unutterably precious, so sacred a bond should be endangered, for the sake of representing certain words more accurately,--here and there translating a tense with greater precision, getting rid of a few archaisms? <p>It may be confidently assumed that no 'Revision' of our Authorized Version, however judiciously executed, will ever occupy the place in public esteem which is actually enjoyed by the work of the Translators of 1611,--the noblest literary work in the Anglo-Saxon language. We shall in fact never have another 'Authorized Version.' And this single consideration may be thought absolutely fatal to the project, except in a greatly modified form. </p><p>To be brief,--As a companion in study and for private edification: as a book of reference for critical purposes, especially in respect of difficult and controverted passages:--we hold that a revised edition of the Authorized Version of our English Bible, (if executed with consummate ability and learning,) would at any time be a work of inestimable value. The method of such a performance, whether by marginal Notes or in some other way, we forbear to determine. But certainly only as a handmaid is it to be desired. As something intended to supersede our present English Bible, we are thoroughly convinced that the project of rival Translation is not to be entertained for a moment. For ourselves, we deprecate it entirely. </p><p>On the other hand, who could have possibly foresee what has actually come to pass since the Convocation of the Southern Province (in Feb. 1870) declared itself favourable to 'a Revision of the Authorized Version,' and appointed a Committee of Divines to undertake the work? Who was to suppose that the Instructions given to the Revisionists would be by them systematically disregarded? </p><p>Who was to imagine that an utterly untrustworthy 'new Greek Text,' constructed on mistaken principles,--(say rather, or on no principles at all,)--would be the fatal result? To speak more truly,--Who could have anticipated that the opportunity would have been adroitly seized to inflict upon the Church the text of Drs. Westcott and Hort, in all its essential features,--a text which, as will be found elsewhere largely explained, we hold to be the most vicious Recension of the original Greek in existence? </p><p>Above all,--Who was to foresee that instead of removing 'plain and clear errors' from our Version, the Revisionists,--(besides systematically removing out of sight so many of the genuine utterances of the SPIRIT,)--would themselves introduce a countless number of blemishes, unknown to it before? </p><p>Lastly, how was it to have been believed that the Revisionists would show themselves industrious in sowing broadcast over four continents doubts as to the Truth of Scripture, which it will never be in their power either to remove or to recall? "Nescit vox missa reverti." </p><p>For, the ill-advised practice of recording, in the margin of an English Bible, certain of the blunders--(such things cannot by any stretch of courtesy be styled 'Various Readings')--which disfigure 'some' or 'many' 'ancient authorities,' can only result in hopelessly unsettling the faith of millions. </p><p>It can not be defended on the plea of candour,--the candour which is determined that men shall 'know the worst.' 'The worst' has NOT been told: and it were dishonesty to insinuate that it has. If all the cases were faithfully exhibited where a 'few,' or 'some,' or 'many ancient authorities' read differently from what is exhibited in the actual Text, not only would the margin prove insufficient to contain to the record, but the very page itself would not nearly suffice . . . . It is the gross one-sidedness, the patent unfairness, in a critical point of view, of this work, (which professes to be nothing else but a Revision of the English Verses of 1611,)--which chiefly shocks and offends us.</p></p><h2>King of Foxes (Conclave of Shadows, Book 2) (Conclave of Shadows, 2)</h2><p><p>In the mountains of Midkemia,<br>a boy came brutally of age in blood and<br>in terror. And now he lives for one<br>purpose alone ... revenge!</p> <p>An exceptionally skilled swordsman, youngTal Hawkins was the only survivor of the massacre of his village -- rescued, recruited, and trained by the mysterious order of magicians and spies, the Conclave of Shadows. Now one of the secret society's mostvaluable agents, he gains entrance into the court of Duke Olasko, the bloodthirsty and powerful despot whose armies put Tal's village to the sword, by posing as a nobleman from the distant Kingdom of the Isles. But the enemy is cunning and well protected -- in league with the foul necromancer Leso Varen, dark master of death-magic -- and to gain the Duke's trust and confidence, Tal Hawkins must first sell his soul.</p></p><p><p><strong>Raymond E. Feist</strong> is the author of more than 30 previous books, including the internationally bestselling &#x201c;Riftwar Cycle&#x201d; of novels set in his signature world of Midkemia. The Firemane Saga is his first all-new epic fantasy series. He lives in San Diego, California.</p>After destroying the vicious mercenary Raven and partially avenging his people wiped out in 2003's Talon of the Hawk, Tal Hawkins, last of the Orosini, sets his sights on the person who ordered the massacre, Kaspar, Duke of Olasko, in bestseller Feist's latest stirring fantasy. But to get close enough to Kaspar to exact his revenge, he must first win the duke's confidence&#x2014;and accomplishing that may cost Tal his soul. Devoted fans will welcome the author's focus on Roldem and the Eastern Kingdoms, lands that barely figure in earlier books set in Midkemia. The unstable political landscape of the Eastern Kingdoms provides fertile ground for intrigues the like of which have not been seen in the Kingdom of the Isles. Despite his internal conflicts, Tal, an archetypal swashbuckling hero who's unbeatable with a sword, a brilliant tactician and handsome enough to make the ladies swoon, ranks among the least interesting of the characters who populate this part of Midkemia. Far more complex are the supporting cast, chief among them Petro Amafi, a former assassin and Tal's retainer; Quint Havrevulen, Kaspar's Special Captain who took part in the raid on the Orosini; and Kaspar himself&#x2014;all of whom assume unusual depth as the plot progresses. The novel's relentless pace and explosive climactic battle will ensure another crowd-pleaser for Feist to add to his already impressive resume. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Their collaboration resulted in <i>You Have Seen Their Faces</i>, a graphic portrayal of America's desperately poor rural underclass.

Supported by his commentary, they tell how the tenant system exploited whites and blacks alike and fostered animosity between them. Bourke-White, who sometimes waited hours for the right moment, captures her subjects in the shacks where they lived, the depleted fields where they plowed, and the churches where they worshipped.</p></p><p><b>Erskine Caldwell (Author) </b><br> ERSKINE CALDWELL (1903-1987) was born in Newnan, Georgia.

It won the Hugo Award for Best Novel, and has since become a landmark in the field. Now, with the long awaited sequel <i>The Children of the Sky </i>about to be published, we are proud to offer the first-ever trade paperback edition of this big-screen SF classic.</p><p><i>A Fire Upon The Deep</i> is the winner of the 1993 Hugo Award for Best Novel.</p></p><p>In this Hugo-winning 1991 SF novel, Vernor Vinge gives us a wild new cosmology, a galaxy-spanning "Net of a Million Lies," some finely imagined aliens, and much nail-biting suspense. <p> Faster-than-light travel remains impossible near Earth, deep in the galaxy's Slow Zone--but physical laws relax in the surrounding Beyond. Outside that again is the Transcend, full of unguessable, godlike "Powers." When human meddling wakes an old Power, the Blight, this spreads like a wildfire mind virus that turns whole civilizations into its unthinking tools. And the half-mythical Countermeasure, if it exists, is lost with two human children on primitive Tines World. </p><p> Serious complications follow. One paranoid alien alliance blames humanity for the Blight and launches a genocidal strike. Pham Nuwen, the man who knows about Countermeasure, escapes this ruin in the spacecraft <i>Out of Band</i>--heading for more violence and treachery, with 500 warships soon in hot pursuit. On his destination world, the fascinating Tines are intelligent only in combination: named "individuals" are small packs of the doglike aliens. Primitive doesn't mean stupid, and opposed Tine leaders wheedle the young castaways for information about guns and radios. Low-tech war looms, with elaborately nested betrayals and schemes to seize <i>Out of Band</i> if it ever arrives. The tension becomes extreme... while half the Beyond debates the issues on galactic Usenet. </p><p> Vinge's climax is suitably mindboggling. This epic combines the flash and dazzle of old-style space opera with modern, polished thoughtfulness. Pham Nuwen also appears in the nifty prequel set 30,000 years earlier, <i>A Deepness in the Sky</i>. Both recommended. <i>--David Langford, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Praise for <i>A Fire Upon the Deep</i>:<p> "Fleeing a menace of galactic proportions, a spaceship crashes on an unfamiliar world, leaving the survivors--a pair of children--to the not-so-tender mercies of a medieval, lupine race. Responding to the crippled ship's distress signal, a rescue mission races against time to retrieve the children and recover the weapon they need to prevent the universe form being forever changed. Against a background depicting a space-time continuum stratified into 'zones of thought,' the author has created a rarity--a unique blend of hard science, high drama, and superb storytelling." --<i>Library Journal</i></p><p> "A tale that burns with the brazen energy of the best space operas of the golden age.

Although he's seen the many successful unions of his Cynster connections, he has also watched his father's obsessions nearly destroy their family and fortune, a mistake Charles will not repeat. But as Lord Meredith he must marry, so he offers for Sarah, the daughter of his neighbors Lord and Lady Conningham. She's intelligent enough to run his social life, beautiful enough to grace his arm, and old enough to know the value of his offer. </p><p>For most young ladies of the <em>ton</em>, the right marriage is the culmination of years of training, perfect deportment, and intricate plans that would impress a general. But as a lady of independent means with a life of her own, Sarah is unwilling to wed unless it is for unbounded love.</p><p>But Charles always gets what he wants. He convinces Sarah to give him two weeks to win her; if he succeeds, they will marry immediately. And so begins an intense courtship. By day, Charles and Sarah are models of decorum indulging in innocuous walks, polite conversation, sedate waltzes. Each night they steal away to the lush, moonlit gardens, where sensual embraces turn to searing kisses, and much, much more. Both are swept away on a tide of passion and feeling neither can resist.</p><p>And yet, after the wedding, despite nights of insatiable passion, Charles remains aloof, as if the near-sinful sweetness of their nights exists only in a dream. Sarah battles to prove that true love is a force that can't be contained, a gift worth fighting for, but it's only when she's engulfed in a web of increasingly dangerous incidents that Charles discovers how much he's willing to surrender to protect . . . the taste of innocence.</p></p><p><p>#1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Stephanie Laurens began writing as an escape from the dry world of professional science, a hobby that quickly became a career. Her novels set in Regency England have captivated readers around the globe, making her one of the romance world's most beloved and popular authors.</p>This steamy nineteenth-century romance pairs rich Charlie Morwellan, the eighth earl of Meredith, with Sarah Conningham, whose family lands are just to the north. Sarah gives Charlie two weeks to prove hes perfect for her--what ensues is seduction by night and feigned distant interaction by day. The abridgment seems awkward. Cutting out much of the daytime interplay, it emphasizes Sarahs development into a sexually aware woman. Elizabeth Sastre reads the sex scenes with practiced ease but without tension or emotion. But as soon as Sarah consents to marriage, the sex scenes abruptly stop. A subplot, smoothly developed through Sastres expert pacing and intonation, adds some mystery to the story.

In tracing the many surprising forms this influence took, Shapiro draws on many genres&#x2014;poetry, fiction, essays, plays, memoirs, songs, speeches, letters, movie reviews, comedy routines&#x2014;and on a remarkable range of American writers from Emerson, Melville, Lincoln, and Mark Twain to James Agee, John Berryman, Pauline Kael, and Cynthia Ozick. Americans of the revolutionary era ponder the question &#x201c;to sign or not to sign;&#x201d; Othello becomes the focal point of debates on race; the Astor Place riots, set off by a production of Macbeth, attest to the violent energies aroused by theatrical controversies; Jane Addams finds in King Lear a metaphor for American struggles between capital and labor. Orson Welles revolutionizes approaches to Shakespeare with his legendary productions of Macbeth and Julius Caesar; American actors from Charlotte Cushman and Ira Aldridge to John Barrymore, Paul Robeson, and Marlon Brando reimagine Shakespeare for each new era. The rich and tangled story of how Americans made Shakespeare their own is a literary and historical revelation. As a special feature, the book includes a foreword by Bill Clinton, among the latest in a long line of American presidents, including John Adams, John Quincy Adams, and Abraham Lincoln, who, as the collection demonstrates, have turned to Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays for inspiration.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

Rosen explains how the practitioner identifies tensions in the body that point to the source of a problem and how that awareness guides the healing process. With the help of psychotherapist Susan Brenner, the director of Rosen Center East and one of Marion&#39;s first students, she describes the origins of her method; how people reveal their emotions in body postures; barriers they set up to love, self-expression, and intimacy, and how Rosen work enables a client to move beyond these barriers. Treatments for asthma, migraine headaches, heart problems, weak immune systems, and psychosomatic illnesses are chronicled. Essays by doctors, psychologists, and Rosen practitioners describe how this method of touch, words, and acceptance guides their work, and complete this remarkable tribute to a visionary woman.</p><p>Rosen Method bodywork was developed out of Marion Rosen's fifty years of experience as a physical therapist and health educator.
